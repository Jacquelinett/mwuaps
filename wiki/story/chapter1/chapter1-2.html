                <p>[Scene] Hunter gets up from his bed and make a beeline toward Airi as she walks down the stair. He
                    affectionately rubs his head against her leg, and Airi reciprocates it by leaning down to pet him.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Good morning Hunter”</li>
                    <li>[Hunter]: “Meooowwwww”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Scene] Airi walks over to the fridge and grabs a box of cat food and pours it into Hunter’s food
                    bowl nearby then puts the box back.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Hmm, I should make some breakfast and coffee”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: Since this is a story-focused game, the player’s second task is to play a cooking
                    minigame to help
                    Airi prepares breakfast. To proceed, the player will need to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interact with the fridge, where Airi will get [Egg] and [Ham].</li>
                    <li>Interact with the expresso machine to turn it on.</li>
                    <li>Interact with the pan on the stove to initiate a cooking minigame, where the player will select
                        and cook
                        [Egg] and [Ham] together.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Scene]: Airi, in a comical video game fashion, will open her mouth wide and slide the content of the
                    pan into her mouth and gobble it up in one go. She will also down her coffee in one go. She then
                    stretches her arm, remarking “Okay gotta go now”, grab her backpack next to the table and leave,
                    only to come back after 3 seconds to grab the folder from the table before leaving again.</p>

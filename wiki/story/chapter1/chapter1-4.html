                    <li>[Airi sigh and glares at Dara]: “Dara. Not funny”.</li>
                    <li>[Dara]: “Hehe, sorry. Are you ready for your earning report?”.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Probably. Probably not. I don’t know. At this point, I just want to get it over and
                        done with”</li>
                    <li>[Dara gives Airi a cup of coffee]: “Well, good luck girl. Here’s your coffee. Let me know how it
                        goes, see you at lunch yeah?”</li>

                    <li>Dara press the elevator and the door open, she enters, waves to Airi as the door closes. The
                        elevator descends and Airi walks to the left. The camera does not follow Airi however, and once
                        Airi is off-screen the potted plant on the left of the elevator glitches, disappears, and
                        reappears on the right side. The scene fades to black, then to Airi at her desk.</li>
                    <li>Airi puts her cup of coffee down, takes open her backpack, gets her laptop, and hooks it to the
                        monitor. She remarks that she still has some time before her meeting and should take some time
                        to review it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Gameplay]: The player can now explore Airi’s office, but more importantly, they can look at the
                    Airi’s screen and open the summary file, containing bullet points information about quarterly
                    earnings reports, customer satisfaction surveys, etc. It is important that the player review this
                    because the information in this file will be used in an Ace Attorney style minigame coming up next.

                    <li>Once the player is ready, they can walk into a presentation room at the bottom where there are
                        already a few businesspeople sitting inside.
                    </li>
                    <li>The minigame will start, where Airi will be showing a Powerpoint presentation while giving a
                        talk. Occasionally, Airi will be interrupted by a listener, and they will ask her questions. The
                        player will have to answer them with the correct response (from the summary the player read
                        earlier).
                    </li>
                    <li>The player will also have the option to check the summary file during the minigame in case they
                        forget something.
                    </li>
                    <li>Every time Airi answers a question right, she gains more confidence, and after 4 correct
                        answers, Airi will continue with her presentation as the screen fade to black then back to Airi
                        saying “And that concludes my reports” and everyone in the room applauds.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Scene] One by one, the businesspeople walk up to Airi, shake her hand, tell her variation of “Good
                    job” and exit the room. Once everyone left, Airi let out a sigh and slumps her chair, looking at the
                    ground. Just then, the screen glitch, changing her presentation on her projector to a slide about
                    “Applied Machine Learning Usecase - Customer Satisfaction”. Airi notices it and is visibly confused.
                    She remarks “What the heck”. Before she could look into the presentation, her computer display the
                    blue screen of death and restart itself. Airi shrugs it off, remarking “Must be a bug. Oh well, I
                    gotta get back to work”.
                </p>
                <p>[Gameplay]: The player can now walk around again, but once they sit down at Airi’s desk, their
                    movement will be switched to moving in a rolling chair. While they are sitting on the chair, the
                    movement will be limited, but there will be 3 actions they can only do while sitting in the chair.
                    The 3 actions are:
                </p>

                                paperwork,
                                her cup glitches and there’s an identical pen appearing in the cup.</li>
                            <li>When Airi finishes with her paperwork and puts her pen back, she remarks “Have there
                                always been
                                two pens here?”.</li>

                                work. Her
                                cup glitches as she looks away. A moment after, Airi stops and unconsciously reaches for
                                her
                                supposedly empty cup and drinks from it.</li>

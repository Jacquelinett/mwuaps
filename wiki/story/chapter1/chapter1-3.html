                Airi heads to work via the subway. On the way, she sees a shooting star and wishes that her life is more
                than just a boring office job. Just then, the TV on the subway glitches and broadcasts breaking news of
                someone potentially suicide by jumping off the same building that Airi works at. No one around here
                seems to notice. Her co-worker Dara who was already at work does not see anything going on at the
                building.

                <p>[Gameplay]: The player now has a section of the city open up, where they are free to explore around.
                    For the most part, there won’t be any important things the player needs to do, but there will be
                    minigames and easter eggs sprinkled around for the player to enjoy. To proceed, the player will need
                    to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enter the subway station.</li>
                    <li>Purchase a ticket to Barricade Street, and Airi will automatically wait and enter the next
                        arrived subway.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Scene] Airi enters a subway. The subway starts moving. After a few seconds, Airi hears a ding from
                    her phone and checks. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>She got a text from her mom asking if she left for work yet. As she texts her mom back, the
                        subway exits the tunnel, and the scene zooms out to see a full cinematic city view as the game’s
                        title drops. </li>
                    <li>Airi takes a moment to enjoy the view without finishing her text. Just then a shooting star
                        shoots across the sky. Airi noticed it and jokingly wished “Man it’s a Monday I don’t want to
                        work. I wish my life is more exciting than just an office job”. </li>
                    <li>Airi finishes responding to her mom. Her mom responds back “Good luck with your meeting”, and
                        Airi smile, then put her phone away and enjoy the view some more.</li>
                    <li>Just then, the TV inside the subway suddenly glitches, and a piece of breaking news started
                        broadcasting:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>News Reporter: “Breaking news today reporting to you live! This morning outside the
                            headquarters of BigCorp Inc. remains of someone who appeared to have fallen off the
                            fifty-one-story building, Police have yet to identify the victim but they seem to be leaning
                            more into the motive of suicide as there seemed to be no signs of foul play--”.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Airi exclaims out loud “Wait, that’s where I work”. She quickly texts her best friend and
                        coworker - Dara:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>[Airi]: “Dara, are you at work? Did you see the breaking news?”.</li>
                        <li>[Dara]: “What news? The WcDonald opening down the street? And yeah I’m at work”</li>
                        <li>[Airi]: “No. Not that. I just saw on the news that someone died falling off our building.
                            Can we even go to work today?”.</li>
                        <li>[Dara]: “Well I only got here about 10 minutes ago, but I don’t see anything like that.
                            Everyone seems to be working as normal. But I will go check”.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Airi looks up from her phone and sees that no one else seems to be paying any attention to the
                        breaking news. As she looks around, the TV glitches and broadcasts a cooking show. Airi’s phone
                        ring.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>[Dara]: “Nope, I looked, no cops, no dead body. Are you okay Airi?”.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Airi quickly glances around the subway one more time - no one else seems concerned. Airi text
                        Dara
                        back.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>[Airi]: “I… might have imagined it then. Sorry, I’m almost there, see you in a bit”.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The PA announce that the subway is arriving at Barricade Street. The subway then slows to a stop, and Airi exits.</li>

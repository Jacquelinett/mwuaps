                <p>[Scene]: Airi and the man walk together, and Airi will remarks that “Wow, the skyline is so
                    beautiful, Mark”. The man, who will be referred to as Mark from now on, smiles at Airi and hugs her.
                    Mark tells Airi “It’s cold, do you want some coffee?” in which Airi will nod. Mark will tell Airi to
                    “Pick your poison”</p>
                <p>[Gameplay]: The player can now control Airi again, and Mark will follow Airi wherever she walks. To
                    proceed, the player will need to interact with the coffee shop, giving them some coffee flavor
                    choices. It doesn’t matter which they pick, although whatever choice they pick will be remembered
                    for later. Mark will then ask Airi to sit down at the nearby bench, and the player will have to
                    interact with the bench.</p>
                [Scene]: Once Airi sits down, Mark will sit down next to her. He turns around to look at the
                skyline, and remarks that it’s a beautiful night. Airi agrees with him, then he turns around, get off
                the bench, and on to his knee, he then grabs a box from his pocket, and tell Airi:
                <ul>
                    <li>[Mark]: “But it isn’t as beautiful as you. Mari, I can’t imagine growing old without you, will
                        you marry me?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi blushes]: “I... I would be happy to”</li>
                    <li>Mark put the ring onto Airi’s finger, then stand up and kiss her</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: Mark, this is embarrassing but can I go to the bathroom?</li>
                    <li>[Mark]: “Yeah of course”</li>
                    <li>Airi runs to the bathroom. Once inside, she squeals, flustered from excitement. She then walks
                        toward the mirror to wash her hand, where the player will see that it’s not Airi in the mirror,
                        but the brunette from the vision Airi had. When Airi notices the mirror, she wakes up from her
                        dream.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Scene]: Airi jolts awake as her TV is showing the local news discussing the suicide of an employee
                    at Big Inc Corp. Airi, half asleep, turns the TV off. She realizes it was the news, remark “Oh shit”
                    and turn the TV back on. Oddly enough, the news is no longer there, and instead, she is greeted with
                    some cooking channels. Airi frantically change the channels, but couldn’t find the news again.
                    Defeated, she turns it off and looks at her phone, remarks that it’s “Oh shit it’s 1 am. Fuck. I
                    need to feed my cat and get some food.”</p>
                <p>[Gameplay]: As expected, to proceed, the player will need to interact with the cat food bowl, then
                    check the fridge. Airi will notice that there’s no food she wants to eat and check her phone for a
                    food place that’s still open. Airi finds a place one subway station away, and the player will need
                    to leave the apartment and walk out in the street to the 30th Street subway station.</p>

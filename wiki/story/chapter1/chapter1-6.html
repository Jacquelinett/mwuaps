<h5>1.6 [Location: Subway, then Cherrygrove City - 30th Street, then Airi’s apartment]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: Airi is on a subway, which isn’t as crowded as it was earlier in the morning. After some
time, there will be another subway going in the opposite direction as the one Airi is on. There is a blond man standing
near one of the windows, looking down at his phone on that subway. Once Airi gets off the subway, the street back is
also the same, minus the people. Airi’s apartment will also be the same as she left it in the morning.

                Airi heads home via the subway. On her way, she has a vision of a man and woman she never met hugging,
                only to notice that same man on another subway very briefly when her subway and that one crosses each
                other going in the opposite direction. Once Airi got back to her apartment, she passes out on the couch.

                <p>[Scene]: Airi gets on the subway and sits down on the bench and sighs. She sits still for a moment,
                    then turns her head around to look at the city as the subway leaves the tunnel. Another subway on
                    the opposite track goes by, but Airi pays no attention to it. Suddenly Airi has a vision of a blonde
                    man and a brunette woman hugging each other. </p>
                <p>[Animated Cutscene]: Airi grab her head, writhing in pain, paying no attention to the opposite subway
                    passing through her. As a blonde man on the opposite train come into the scene, the scene slows
                    down. As Airi and the man get closer, Airi notices him and jolts. The man is the same man from the
                    vision she just got. As the man gets farther away in the opposite direction, the scene resumes in
                    speed and Airi instinctively runs with the subway but stops as she approaches the end of the
                    carriage she’s in.</p>
                <p>[Scene]: Airi sit down on the bench, confused. Airi thinks out loud to herself - “Have I ever met him
                    before? Why does he feel so familiar?” The subway eventually enters the tunnel, the PA announce the
                    arrival at 30th Street station, and the subway slows down to a stop.</p>
                <p>[Gameplay]: The player can now control Airi. Airi remark that she could really use a nap and wanted
                    to head home. To proceed, the player just needs to take Airi back to her apartment, then to her
                    couch.</p>
                <p>[Scene]: Airi turns on the TV and changes channels a few times to try to find the news from earlier.
                    She then passes out from tiredness and dreams about the man from earlier.</p>
                <p>[Scene]Airi sat down on the bench, her face pressed against the window, staring at the city,
                    seemingly distracted. A moment after, another subway on an opposite track go by, but Airi remained
                    distracted.</p>

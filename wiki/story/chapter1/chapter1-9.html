<h5>1.9 [Location: The Shooting Star Express and Applewood]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: Airi is on the Shooting Star Express, which has 3 rooms in the following order: a small
navigation room with various train controlling machines; a reception room where the entrance is with a bunch of benches,
and a strange headwear device and machine connected to the wall; a multipurpose room with a kitchen, dining table,
chairs, and a bunk bed. There is also a small balcony at the end of the train, where Airi can enjoy the nature view
without a window. After the train exit the tunnel, Airi will be outside of Applewood, which has a forest on the left
side of the train track, a field, and a river on the right side. When Airi arrive at a train station in Applewood, there
are a few roofs that provide shades. A figure in a cloak stands inside one of these shadows, allowing the player to only
see its silhouette. Otherwise, the station is a typical train station with nothing special.

                Airi meets Mari, the brunette girl from her dream, on the train. Airi finds out that Mari has lost her
                memory. The train leaves the tunnel it was in, revealing to Airi that she is somehow back in her
                hometown, Applewood, during the daytime, despite it being supposed to be 2 am and her hometown is 4
                hours away from the city. The train stop at Applewood’s train station, where Airi and Mari are about to
                meet a spooky scary skeleton.

                <p>[Gameplay]: The scene fades back into Airi sitting on one of the benches in the reception room. She
                    remarks that she’s bored and wants to explore the train. The player can now explore the train, where
                    they can find and interact with Mari (the brunette girl from Airi’s dream), who is sitting on the
                    bottom
                    of the bunk bed in the multipurpose room.</p>

                <p>[Scene]:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Oh hey! You… look like a human, you are one… right?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari look up at Airi]</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Oh wait, you are that girl… from my dream. Uh, what was your name… Mari right?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari is silent and just stare at Airi]</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Sorry, you are probably weirded out, and to be honest, I am too. For some reason, I had
                        a dream of you and some guy named Mark together. I’m Airi, by the way. How did you end up here?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Hi… Sorry, I… can’t seem to remember anything. I woke up on this train a while ago with
                        a headache so I have been just resting here. I think I lost my memory… I don’t remember how I got
                        here.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Ah… that’s okay. Don’t worry, I’m just as confused as you are. I got on a subway to go
                        get some food but somehow ended up at a creepy abandoned station before meeting a talking
                        skeleton who convinced me to get on this train. Crazy stuff huh”</li>
                    <li>[Mari nod]</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Well, regardless, I’m just happy to see a human face, makes me feel sane haha. ”</li>
                    <li>Just then, the train exits the tunnel, and sunlight shine through the windows of the train,
                        brightening everything up. Airi is confused, exclaiming that it was supposed to be like 2 am in
                        the morning, and runs to the balcony, where she sees the beautiful scenery. She excitedly tells 
                        Mari to come to take a look and Mari walks to the balcony, standing next to her.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Animated Cutscene]: The cutscene starts with a view of the bottom of the train, showing the wheels
                    and track, slowly panning up to Airi and Mari looking at the scenery in awe. The scene zooms out to show
                    the side of the train, where a group of boys is running, one of them flying a kite. A bird comes into
                    the view, and the camera follows the bird up to reveal a top-down view of the scenery. Scene fade to black.</p>

                <p>[Scene]:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Wait… I recognize this place. This is the forest that is just outside of Applewood
                        Town. I grew up here!”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “It’s a really pretty place, Airi”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “But, this doesn’t make any sense, from Cherrygrove City it would take like 4 hours on a
                        car drive to get here, I don’t know how long I been here but it definitely hasn’t even been an hour”</li>
                    <li>Just then, the train approaches an outdoor station and slows down to a stop. Comic’s voice is
                        heard on the PA, saying “Arriving at Applewood Station! Please get off the train for a bit”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: The player will need to guide Airi off the train. Mari will follow behind. Once off the
                    train, the player will need to walk up near the cloaked figure, where Airi will say “Excuse me”</p>

                <p>[Scene]: The cloaked figure opens his eyes, revealing blue fiery eyeballs, followed by the entire
                    head lighting up in the green fire, revealing a skull as the head. The figure turns around and walks out
                    of the shade, revealing himself to also be a skeleton. The skeleton says: “Welcome, Airi and Mari. I
                    have been waiting for you”. The scene cut to black as Airi scream “AAAAAAAAAA”.</p>

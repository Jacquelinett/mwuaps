                Airi goes on the subway, intending on getting off at Cathedral St station to go get some food. However,
                the subway glitches and drop Airi off at some abandoned station with a train instead. Airi meets Comic,
                a talking skeleton and train conductor for the Shooting Star Express. Comic explains to Airi that she’s
                here because she made a wish upon a shooting star. Comic convince Airi to go with him to see his boss,
                and if Airi still wants to head home after, his boss will take her home. Airi reluctantly agrees and
                gets on the train.

                <p>[Scene]: Airi gets on the subway, sits on one of the benches, and looks at her phone. A moment after,
                    the PA announce that the subway is arriving at the Cathedral Street Station. Suddenly, the whole
                    subway
                    glitch and the PA announce “Now Arriving At !@#$%^”. Airi looks up for her phone, confused as to
                    what
                    had just happened as the subway slow down and eventually stop. Airi nervously poke her head out of
                    the
                    opened door and slowly walk outside.</p>

                <p>[Gameplay]: The player will take Airi to explore the abandoned station, interacting with a schedule
                    board - Airi will remark that she does not understand how this schedule works, and a map of the
                    subway
                    station - Airi does not recognize the system. Once done, a train horn will be heard in the distance,
                    and
                    a train will slowly come to a stop near the station. Airi will need to walk and interact with it,
                    where
                    she will remark that she has never seen a train like it before.</p>

                <p>[Scene]: A running noise can be heard from off-screen, someone is running toward Airi, saying “Shit.
                    Shit. I hope I’m not too late.” A moment after, a skeleton in a train conductor outfit sprints at
                    Airi,
                    screaming at her “WATCH OUT”. Airi tried to avoid the skeleton but was too late and he slam into
                    her,
                    and they both falls on the floor. The skeleton gets up and extends his hand to help get Airi up, but
                    as
                    soon as Airi saw the skeletal hand, she looks up and gets a good look at the skeleton.</p>

                    <li>[Airi]: “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH”</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton]: “AAAAAAAAAAAHHHH”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “WTF A SKELETON”</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton]: “AAAAAAAAA HUMAN WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING AT ME”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “WHY????? MAYBE IT BECAUSE YOU ARE A FREAKING SKELETON!”</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton]: “I CANT HELP WHAT I AM”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I’M SORRY I DIDN’T MEAN TO HURT YOUR FEELING”</li>
                    <li>*Awkward silence for a solid 3 second*</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH”</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton]: “WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING AGAIN??????”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “BECAUSE YOU CAN TALK!!!”</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton]: “YOU ARE MORE SURPRISED BY THE FACT THAT I CAN TALK THAN THE FACT THAT I’M A
                        SKELETON?”</li>
                    <li>*Airi stop screaming and just seem startled*</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You know what. You got a point there”</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton]: “It’s okay. I get it a lot. I’m used to it by now”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “S…Sorry, I didn’t mean to”</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton]: “It’s all good. Anyway, I have a job to do, so excuse me, miss”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Scene] The skeleton walks onto the train, grabs the manifest list, and looks at it. He then walks
                    back
                    outside while looking at the manifest, then looks up at Airi.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Skeleton]: “Are you Airi?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi is surprised he know her name]: “Uh… yes. How do you know?”</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton]: “Great! I’m Comic, the train conductor. I’m in charge of taking care of you today!
                        It said
                        here you are a VIP too, wow, you don’t see many VIP these days”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I’m sorry what?”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “You are a VIP! I’m a bit jealous, it means you get special privileges!”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “No no. Not that, sorry. I don’t remember buying a train ticket, what is this train?
                        Where does
                        it go? What do you mean by taking care of me?”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Do you not remember? You <i>*asked*</i> to be on this trip. This is the Shooting Star
                        Express, we
                        grant people’s wishes and a few other things. It said here that you ‘wished for a more exciting
                        life
                        than an office job’. Is that not your wish?</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Aw shit, I did make that wish didn’t I. Fuck. Uh I was just saying it I didn’t really
                        think
                        this would happen”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Please do not worry! This isn’t a horror <i>game</i> or anything”</li>
                    <li>[Comic turn over and stare at the player and wink]</li>
                    <li>[Airi turns over to look at the player]: “W...who are you winking at? ...<span
                            style="font-size: 0.6em;">weirdo</span>”</li>
                    <li>[Airi turns back over to look at Comic]: “Can I go home instead? I’m not sure how I feel about
                        this”</li>
                    <li>[Comic walk aboard the train]: “Come with me to the next stop and let my boss gives you the sale
                        pitch, if you still want to go home then, he can take
                        you home.”</li>
                    <li>[Airi sigh]: “Look like I don't have any other choices huh. Okay, I will go with you”</li>
                    <li>Airi walks aboard the train. The door closes and the train starts moving as the scene fades to
                        black.</li>

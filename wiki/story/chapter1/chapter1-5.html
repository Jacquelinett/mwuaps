<h5>1.5 [Location: BigCorp Inc - 3rd Floor/Cafeteria, Cherrygrove - Barricade St]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: Airi is at the Cafeteria on the 3rd floor, which has long counters with food displayed in
cases on the right of the elevator, vending machine on the left. There are many tables in the room. Once Airi leave, the
street she will be on will be the same as the previous scene, minus minor changes since people don’t stay in the same
spot all day.

                Airi has lunch with Dara and shares with her about various strange things that happened to her. Dara
                thinks Airi is probably just seeing things because she’s underslept from staying up late and stressing
                out over her presentation and suggests that she take the rest of the day off. Airi initially refuses,
                but after her food glitches and Dara doesn’t seem to notice it at all, Airi agrees to head home.

                <p>[Scene] Airi enters the Cafeteria and Dara waves at her from a table. Airi waves back to her and
                    remarks that she should get some food then go sit with Dara.
                </p>
                <p>[Gameplay] The player can control the player to buy some food from the counter as well as use the
                    vending machine to get whatever they want. What the player buys won’t matter storywise. Once the
                    player got Airi some food, they will need to go sit down with Dara.
                </p>
                <p>[Scene]: Dara will make some remark about the kind of food the player got for Airi (as an example:
                    “Chocolate? Your day were that bad huh?”), and Airi will responses “Yeah it’s been a crazy day”. To
                    make it simple, we assume the player picks a salad for Airi.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Dara]: “Do you want to talk about it?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I do, but I feel like if I tell you you would just think I’m going insane”</li>
                    <li>[Dara]: “So basically how I feel about you every day”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I’m serious Dara. I’m seeing things. Strange things had been happening to me today. At
                        first, I thought I saw a piece of breaking news about someone jumping off our building, then I
                        thought I finished my coffee but apparently, I didn’t”.</li>
                    <li>[Dara]: “That sounds normal to me”.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “But that’s not all. I was somehow able to see the future, I thought I saw James
                        dropping by my cubicle to give me the same work documents twice today, but apparently, I must
                        have dreamt it because when he asked me to look over those same documents the second time, the
                        first one somehow disappeared and James acted like it was the first time he talked to me today.
                        It’s like I saw the future before it happened.</li>
                    <li>[Dara]: “I see. Well. I don’t think you are crazy. I do however think that you are probably
                        underslept and just really stressed out in general due to your meeting. How late did you stay up
                        to work on your presentation last night?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Uh. I don’t know, maybe 1-2 am? I honestly forgot”</li>
                    <li>[Dara]: “That’s way too late for a girl to stay up. You probably should take the rest of today
                        off to get some more sleep”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I don’t know. There are just… so much work to do”</li>
                    <li>Just then, whichever food Airi got glitches, and turn into another random food. Airi does notice
                        the
                        glitches this time and is shocked.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Dara… did you… see that?”</li>
                    <li>[Dara]: “See what?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: My salad..., it changed.</li>
                    <li>[Dara]: “What do you mean? You didn’t get any salad”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What? You even commented on it earlier”</li>
                    <li>[Dara]: “Huh? I didn’t comment about your salad, when we were over there at the counter you told
                        me
                        you were getting a salad and I just said ok. That’s all I said”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Wait. You weren’t at the counter with me, you were already sitting at the table when I
                        got
                        here”</li>
                    <li>[Dara stare at Airi silently]</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You know what. I will take the rest of the day off. I might be sleep deprived”</li>
                    <li>[Dara]: “Yeah… that might be best. Get some rest so we can go karaoke tomorrow lol”</li>
                    <li>[Airi rolls her eyes]: “Is that really what’s on your mind right now?”</li>
                    <li>[Dara laugh]: “I’m always down for karaoke”</li>
                    <li>[Airi sigh]: “Okay, well I’m going to head out now. Have a good rest of your day”</li>
                    <li>[Dara]: “Bye Airi, take care”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Gameplay]: The player can now go back up to the 35th floor to grab Airi’s belonging and then head to
                    the subway to head back. At this point, fast travel feature will be introduced so the player doesn’t
                    have to manually walk/wait in the elevator]</p>

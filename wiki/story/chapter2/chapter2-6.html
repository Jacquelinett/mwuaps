<h5>2.6 [Location: Mari’s 2nd flashback and aboard the Shooting Star Express]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: For the most part, the Shooting Star Express remains the same as the previous scenes. The
only difference is that the table in the multipurpose room is filled with plates and dishes of foods, such as “orange
chicken”, soup, rice, however you imagine an Asian family meal might look like. In this part, Comic will be wearing a
chef hat, and Astraeus isn’t on the train. At the beginning of this part, Mari will be having an intense flashback
similar to 2-4 with the background all jumbled up. In her flashback, initially, there will be one silhouette standing in
front of her talking to her, then another silhouette shows up to talk to her. Mari then walks to her right where the two
current silhouettes disappear, and instead a bunch more silhouettes show up, appearing to be gossiping about her. At the
end of Mari’s walk, all the silhouettes disappear and instead, there is a baby and a silhouette next to her at the end.
During the food cutscene, Astraeus will enter from the train entrance and join Airi and Mari for dinner. After Airi
inputs the next memory into the machine, Astraeus will be reading a newspaper while drinking coffee at the dining table,
while Mari is helping Comic with the dishes.

                Mari has another flashback as soon as she and Airi are back on the Shooting Star Express. In her
                flashback, she had a fight with her parents and stormed out of the room, where there are a bunch of
                people gossiping about her. Mari sees her sister at the end of her flashback, remembers her sister’s
                name was Ayaka, and broke down crying. Airi and Mari bond over their increasingly similar pasts,
                motivating each other to move forward. Since the last 2 memories have been sad for Airi, Mari suggests
                that they go to a happy memory next instead and Airi decides to go to the zoo. Airi and Mari eat, do the
                dishes and head out.

                <p>[Scene]: Mari is having a flashback where a silhouette is talking to her:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I DON’T WANT TO BE HERE DAD. I wish you weren’t my parents. All you ever do is give me
                        homework and make me take stupid classes I don’t really care for.</li>
                    <li>[Silhouette]: “Don’t you dare talk to me that way. I’m doing this for you. I’m trying to help
                        you. Do you think I want someone like you at the office? No, you are a disgrace, I would rather
                        be a beggar and have a normal kid than someone like you. But we are trying to help you so that
                        despite what you are, you can still be a productive member of society. The least you can do is
                        shut up, do as you are told, and stay out of everybody’s sight so you don’t bring shame on our
                        family”</li>
                    <li>Another silhouette appears in the background</li>
                    <li>[Second Silhouette]: “Please listen to your father. He cares for you.”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Fuck you both”</li>
                    <li>Mari turns around and starts running, the two silhouettes disappear and a different set of
                        silhouettes appear instead, seemingly gossiping about Mari. Mari runs toward a silhouette
                        standing next to the baby, and as she gets closer, she slows down. The silhouette notices Mari
                        and tells her to “Come! Say hi to Ayaka!”</li>
                    <li>Mari slowly walks toward the baby, drops to the ground on her knee, and starts sobbing.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Scene]: We cut back to Airi and Mari at the entrance of the train, Airi walks forward and starts
                    talking without looking at Mari, who is writhing in pain, with her hand holding her head.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You know, it’s kinda funny that you have a little sister. Considering how similar our
                        pasts are, if you had a little brother too I would have believed that we are the same person
                        from a parallel universe or something”</li>
                    <li>Airi stretch, waiting for a response</li>
                    <li>[Airi turns around to look at Mari]: “...Mari? MARI, ARE YOU OKAY?”</li>
                    <li>Airi run over to Mari and shake her repeatedly, eventually Mari quickly shake her head, snap
                        back to the present</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Hey. Sorry. Yeah. I’m okay. I just… had another flashback”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Nothing to be sorry for. Are you sure you are okay? You seemed to be in pain. Were you
                        able to remember anything?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yup, I’m okay, I think. And I guess so, I could remember some conversations I had with
                        my parents, but for some reason, I can’t seem to recall their faces. And I remember my sister’s
                        name.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I see. What was her name?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Ayaka”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Oo, that’s a pretty name. Funnily enough, I remember hearing that name somewhere
                        before. Can’t seem to recall it right now though”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Well, if you do remember please let me know”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I will try to remember. Was there anything else you remember? Anything that could give
                        me an idea of where to take you next?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Unfortunately no. But, I thought about it Airi, you don’t have to take me to places
                        that are painful for you. Both the school and the hospital seemed to cause you emotional pain. I
                        appreciate your help but I don’t want you to put yourself in painful memories for me”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It’s really fine Mari, those were sad memories, yes but, it’s not like it really
                        affects me any more. It’s the past, it is what it is, I’m not going to let something like that
                        affect me”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “You are really brave Airi. You aren’t just reliving your painful memories, you are
                        allowing yourself to be vulnerable and let someone else see it. To be honest, the more I seem to
                        remember, the more scared I become, after all, I must have killed myself for a reason right? I
                        can’t seem to remember all the details but it seems like… My childhood was painful. Had our
                        situation reversed, I would probably be too ashamed and probably would have chased you out of my
                        memory.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I think you are giving me more credit than I deserve Mari. It’s not even like I had a
                        horrible childhood. I was always well-fed and thanks to my parents, I have a decent job at a
                        decent company. Could it be better? Yes, but I’m not letting it bother me. I don’t know much
                        about you Mari, and I’m sure you have your demons, but regardless of what your past is like, I
                        hope you can find it in you to accept it and live on.</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “...I hope so”</li>
                    <li>[Airi smile]: “Tell you what. Why don’t we go to the zoo next? It is probably one of my happiest
                        childhood memories. Since Applewood is a small town, there was only one zoo in the town. so if
                        you grew up here surely you must have come there at one point”</li>
                    <li>[Mari smile]: “That sounds like fun! I would love to”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Alright! It is decided then. Now can we please go eat some food I’m hungry”</li>
                    <li>[Mari’s stomach growl]: “Shit. Now that you said it, yes, I’m starving. I wonder what Comic have
                        for us”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: It’s pretty obvious but to start the next part, the player just needs to go talk to Comic
                    and ask if the food is ready. The foods are already on the table, but I want the player to interact
                    with Comic instead to start the scene and save the food on the tables for optional dialogs, such as
                    Airi observing and remarking that “the chicken meat looks… kind of weird”. I will probably add some
                    more “fun” lore too, such as Astraeus, who isn’t on the train at the moment, forgot to put away his
                    diary, and Airi can pick it up and read it and see some cheeky comments Astraeus wrote.</p>

                <p>[Scene]: Airi and Mari are sitting at the dining table, and Comic is serving them food. Airi and Mari
                    start eating</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Comic, wow, your chicken is really good. What’s your secret?”</li>
                    <li>[Comic turns over and wink at the player, breaking the 4th wall]: “A programmer’s magic”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Huh? What kind of answer is that? You are soooo weird”</li>
                    <li>Airi keeps on eating, a moment after, from off-screen the sound of the door opens, and after a
                        moment Astraeus enters, walks to the table and sits down.</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Cheers, Airi, Mari. Hope you had a great adventure so far”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It was good, and it seems like Mari is remembering a lot more with each trip. What
                        about you? Where did you go?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “I had to go play detective for a lost spirit helping her find out who murdered her
                        so she could move on. You know, typical god stuff. Pretty boring”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “That sound kinda fun actually”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Well maybe once this is all over I might hire you as an assistant to do them for me
                        eh?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus take a bite of the “chicken”]: “OI, Comic, the bat is really good”</li>
                    <li>[Airi coughs and spit the food reflexively]: “W...What did you say?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus replies nonchalantly, taking another bite as he speaks]: “I was complimenting Comic’s
                        cooking, his bat meat is outstanding this time. Very juicy”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “T...This is bat meat?”</li>
                    <li>[Comic make a face and start waddling backward]: “...Oh boy oh geez all of the sudden I need to
                        go to the bathroom, talk to you in a bit”</li>
                    <li>[NOTICE: IF AIRI INTERACTED WITH COMIC IN 2-4 AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE IS PREPPING, THE FOLLOWING
                        DIALOG HAPPEN]</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “But… you told me you were hunting a ‘ferocious bird’, your word exactly… I thought bird
                        mean chicken in context”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “No comment”</li>
                    <li>[Airi put her chopstick down and just stop eating completely]: “I see”</li>
                    <li>[Airi look over at Mari, who is still eating happily]: “Mari wtf how can you still eat after
                        that?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari put more food in her mouth and answer without looking at Airi]: “Food is good. Taste like
                        chicken”</li>
                    <li>[Airi glares at Mari]: “I see… well. I think I’m full now. I’m gonna… go uh… OH. I’m gonna go
                        input my memory into the machine. See you guys later”</li>
                    <li>[Mari doesn’t stop eating]: “Your loss Airi. Food is good”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: Mari is NOT with Airi for the time being. As the dialog suggests, the player needs to go
                    input the 3rd memory, which is now a 4x3 sliding puzzle of a zoo with a giraffe. Once that is done,
                    Airi will remark that she should go grab Mari to head to the next destination. The player can now
                    optionally talk to Astraeus for some more lore story, or talk to Mari, who’s helping Comic with the
                    dishes.</p>

                <p>[Scene]: Airi join in with Mari and Comic on doing the dishes</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Was the food really that bad, Airi?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi sigh]: “No. It does taste good, I did enjoy it before I found out what it was…”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “I see”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Sorry, I didn’t mean any offense, it just I’m not used to it”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “None taken. Tell you what, finish the dishes for me and we can call it even”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Deal”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “I will leave you two to it then”</li>
                    <li>Comic walks away, leaving Mari and Airi to do the dishes</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “The machine is all set up and ready to go, Mari, whenever you are good to go”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Thank you. Let’s go once we finish this”</li>
                    <li>A moment of silent pass by</li>
                    <li>[Airi blushes]: “Says, Mari, what you said back there, about me being brave and all that. Did
                        you really mean it?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah, of course, you are showing your vulnerable past to a complete stranger, if that
                        isn’t brave, I don’t know what that is</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I was just trying to be cool so I brushed it off earlier, but I really appreciate it.
                        It is a bit hard to relive through some of these memories. It makes me a bit angry even to
                        remember some of the stuff that my parents did. I try to not blame them and put on a brave face
                        but, it stings sometimes.</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I know what you mean. Good intentions don’t always mean good outcomes. From what I have
                        seen so far you definitely had a rough childhood, despite what you may think. You should be
                        proud of yourself.</li>
                    <li>[Airi blush]: “Y...you flatter me”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “It’s the truth. If only I have the strength to face my past head-on… maybe then I
                        wouldn’t be here today”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “We don’t know why you suicided, Mari. Maybe you did have the strength but the
                        circumstance was just really bad. And regardless of the reason, you have the chance to fix it
                        now, Mari”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I guess so”</li>
                    <li>Another moment of silence</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Whew, we are finally done. Let’s go?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yep. Let’s go”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: Mari is back in Airi’s party, and will follow Airi wherever she goes. To wrap up this
                    part, the player just needs to take Airi to the machine and select the new memory.</p>

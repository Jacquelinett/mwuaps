<h5>2.8 [Location: Mari’s 3rd flashback and aboard the Shooting Star Express]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: There is no change in scenery from the previous setting for the Shooting Star Express.
Astraeus will be leaning against the balcony, while Comic will be manning the engine in the engine room. Mari will have
a flashback at the beginning of the scene, and the flashback will be so painful that she faints as soon as she arrives.
In Mari’s flashback, initially, there will be a black silhouette talking at her like in the previous flashback. When
Mari turns around to leave like last time, she will be surrounded by more and more silhouettes showing up
multiplicatively, eventually surrounding her in every direction, all pointing and laughing at her. Mari screams at the
silhouettes to stop but the silhouettes keep on laughing at her, and it goes on until Airi was able to wake Mari up.

                Mari faint as soon as she and Airi got back to the Shooting Star Express. In her flashback/dream, once
                again a silhouette representation of her dad acts mean towards her, telling her that she will be alone
                for the rest of her life. Mari tries to run away, but is trapped by a sea of silhouettes pointing and
                laughing at her. She eventually is able to wake up, and Airi helps her get to the bunk bed where she
                rests. Airi asks Comic about why Mari is in pain every time she remembers, and he suggests that Mari
                subconsciously doesn’t want to remember. Airi talks to Mari after, and explains to Mari that the next
                memory, going to her high school, is the last memory that she can probably help Mari with, since if Airi
                met Mari as an adult, she definitely would remember. Airi and Mari head to the next memory.

                <p>[Scene]: Once again, we are in Mari’s flashback. A silhouette yell at Mari:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Silhouette]: “And what are you going to do about your romantic life?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I… don’t know”</li>
                    <li>[Silhouette]: “Men won’t like you, women won’t like you. You will be alone for the rest of your
                        life”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “It… doesn’t really matter dad. I would rather live alone for the rest of my life than
                        be miserable”</li>
                    <li>[Silhouette]: “But it doesn’t have to be. Why can’t you be normal and carry on your family? You
                        are a disgrace. Leave my sight”</li>
                    <li>Mari turns around and starts walking away, as she walks, more and more silhouettes show up until
                        Mari can't move anymore. Mari is swarmed in a sea of silhouettes, who are all pointing and
                        laughing at her</li>
                    <li>Eventually, Mari stops trying to move, cover her ears with her hand and start screaming
                        “HEEEELPPPP” and the scene cuts straight to the reception room, where Mari is laying on the
                        ground, unconscious. Airi is shaking Mari on her shoulder, trying to get her to wake up. Mari
                        wakes up abruptly also screaming “HEEEELPP”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “MARI. Are you okay?”</li>
                    <li>Mari stops screaming, takes a moment to look at her surroundings. She then stops and makes a
                        teary face, before she hugs Airi and starts sobbing</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Airi, I’m so scared”</li>
                    <li>[Airi pat Mari]: “It’s going to be okay Mari, it’s going to be okay. You are safe now”</li>
                    <li>Mari and Airi sat stills for a moment, Astraeus from off-screen attempted to walk into the room,
                        but saw the situation and slowly walk backward out of sight.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Do you want to talk about it?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari looks down]: “...”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It’s okay Mari, I understand”</li>
                    <li>The two sit quietly again as the scene fades to black. The scene faded back to Mari sitting on
                        the bunk bed, Airi standing in front of her</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Rest for a bit Mari, I’m going to talk to Astraeus for a bit”</li>
                    <li>Mari nod</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: As the dialog suggests, the player needs to talk to Astraeus, who is very nearby. I’m not
                    sure how to make this part more gameplay/gameplay, but unfortunately, another cutscene now happen
                </p>

                <p>[Scene]: Airi walks towards Astraeus, who is leaning against the balcony (possibly smoking for a cool
                    vibe, but I don’t know how I feel about that yet).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Astraeus. The more Mari remembers, the more she seems to be in pain. Is this… is this
                        supposed to happen?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “I don’t know”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What do you mean you don’t know?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Everyone reacts differently when they remember their pasts. Some people feel a
                        sense of dread, some feel a sense of relief, the emotion varies”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Did you do this to her? Why did Mari lose her memory?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “No, everyone loses their memories when they are in limbo, that way their brain
                        doesn’t have to process the fact that they are dead. I did not have any part in this, it is
                        simply the way it is. As I have told you, I’m trying to help”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I see…”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “In Mari’s case though, I don’t know for sure, but I think the reason she’s
                        experiencing so much pain is that subconsciously, she doesn’t want to remember. And as more and
                        more memories resurface, her mind is actively trying to drown them out.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Astraeus… What the fuck happened in Mari’s life? What could be so bad that even in
                        death that she’s still trying to forget?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Sorry Airi, it isn’t my place to answer that question. It’s for Mari to tell you if
                        she chooses”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I see”</li>
                    <li>[Airi mumbles to herself]: “I probably should check on Mari”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: The player needs to go find Mari, who is actually standing in the reception room near the
                    machine, waiting for Airi. The player just need to talk to Mari to proceed</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You are up already? You sure you don’t want to rest some more?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah. I will be fine. I honestly just don’t want to be by myself at the moment”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You won’t be alone, Astraeus and Comic is here”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Do you really want to stay here and talk to two supernatural beings, one is a literal
                        god and the other is a weirdo who talks to an invisible person?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You know what. I can’t argue there”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Sorry. It seems like more and more memories are flooding back to me, even now, and it
                        makes me really scared and restless. I don’t think I can sit still in bed by myself”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Isn’t that a good thing? You can finally remember and choose to live”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I… I guess so”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Well, I’m glad you are remembering more because I’m running out of things to show you.
                        If I have met you as an adult, I definitely would remember, my memories are that good at least.
                        I think the next memory is the last one I have that would be helpful”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Okay. Where are we going?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “My high school, you might have been a student there”</li>
                    <li>A very short flashback of the silhouettes from Mari’s flashback surrounding her from before
                        briefly cut the scene. When it cuts back to the current scene, Mari’s expression is
                        shocked/scared.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Mari… are you… okay?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari shakes her head a few times, squinting her eyes]: “Yeah. Sorry. I’m fine”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Okay. I will be inputting the destination now”</li>
                    <li>To proceed, the player just needs to interact with the machine like before, solve a 4x4 sliding
                        puzzle with a typical high school as the image, then input the memory.</li>
                </ul>

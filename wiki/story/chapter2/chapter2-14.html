<h5>2.14 [Location: The Shooting Star Express, then 30th Street Station]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: Not much changed for both locations. The only thing worth mentioning for this scene is after
Airi gets to drop off at the 30th Street Station, as soon as Airi steps off the Shooting Star Express, it changes into a
regular train and seems like it was never there in the first place.

                Airi attempts to talk to Mari about who Mari is on the Shooting Star Express but Mari is uncomfortable
                about it. Airi tries to talk Mari into choosing to live now that she remembers who she is, but Mari
                seems distant and chooses to go to take a nap instead of seeing Airi off. Astraeus and Comic gave Airi
                tons of food that she ate during the graduation party as a parting gift.

                <p>[Scene]: Airi, Mari, and Astraeus are back on the subway express, where Comic is in the reception
                    room, waiting for them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Welcome back! I hope you guys had a good trip?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “It was quite an eye-opener. What did you think, Mari?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I guess you could say that”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Anyway. I will leave you two to talk for a bit. Comic, go prepare what we talked
                        about”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “On it boss”</li>
                    <li>Astraeus and Comic walks offscreen</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Who is Mark, Mari?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Just someone I know”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Is that all? You seem to be awfully concerned about him if he is just someone you know”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yep. That’s all. Please don’t worry about it Airi. You have helped me so much already,
                        the last thing I want to do is to trouble you some more”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It’s fine, Mari. I’m helping you because I want to”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Thank you”</li>
                    <li>The two stood silently for 3 seconds</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Now that you remember, what are you going to do?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I and Astraeus are going to go observe Mark’s life. I want to see what he is like”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Wait, so do you even know him? I thought you two know each other or something since you
                        know, we literally traverse my college life to find him. But you don’t even know what he is
                        like? Oh god is he like, a bully who pushes you to suicide or something?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari laugh]: “Oh it is nothing like that, please don’t worry”</li>
                    <li>Another awkward silence</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Can you tell me a bit about who you are?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I’m no one important, Airi.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I don’t believe that. Everyone is important in their own way”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I guess so”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Based on your reaction, I guess you don’t want to tell me who you are huh”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Sorry. I’m not trying to upset you Airi, it just… it’s something I’m not comfortable
                        sharing”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “That’s okay. I understand, just promise me one thing: you will… live right?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari avert her eyes/look to the ground]: “Please don’t worry about it”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What are you talking about? How can I not? You are basically a friend now”</li>
                    <li>[Mari’s eyes are still looking at the ground]: “Don’t worry Airi, I will live”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Can you look at me while you say that?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari forces herself to look at Airi]: “Y..yeah. I will… live. Please don’t worry”</li>
                    <li>[Airi sigh]: “Okay. You don’t sound certain, but I will believe you”</li>
                    <li>[Airi force a smile]: “Live so that I can fulfill my promise of breaking you out of your shell,
                        okay?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yup”</li>
                    <li>Another awkward silence</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I’m tired so I think I’m gonna go take a nap in one of the beds. In case you leave
                        before I wake up, thank you Airi. I really, really appreciate this. You helped me so much.”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You are actually tired and not avoiding me right?”</li>
                    <li>Mari gives Airi a hug, then look at Airi and grab her shoulder</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I’m just tired”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Okay. Well, I had a lot of fun too. I hope we will see each other at a bar next time
                        yeah?</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Sound good”</li>
                    <li>Mari starts to walk off-screen. Astraeus then walks back into the scene, standing next to the
                        entrances, leaning against the wall looking cool.</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Whenever you are ready to leave, talk to me”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Gameplay]: This gameplay section serves simply as the last checkpoint for the player in case they
                    want to look around. The player can optionally explore the train, attempt to talk to Mari who is
                    laying down on the bunk bed, in which the only dialog will just be “...”. During the game
                    development I will try to add in a lot of easter eggs and collectibles. Once the player is ready to
                    proceed, they can talk to Astraeus to trigger the final scene for the chapter</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Scene]: Airi talk to Astraeus</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “You are good to go?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Yup”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Just a moment”</li>
                    <li>Astraeus walk over in the direction of the door, but he stops near the next room instead of
                        entering it</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus yells]: “COMIC IS IT READY YET?”</li>
                    <li>[Comic yell]: “COMING BOSS”</li>
                    <li>From off-screen, Comic enters with 3 trays of food stacked on top of each other (with a layer of
                        foil on top of each). He walks up to Airi</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “For you Airi. We know you really enjoyed the food at your graduation party, so we
                        figured as thanks we would make you some”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Wow, you really didn’t have to”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “That’s not all”</li>
                    <li>Astraeus snaps his fingers, then a cake box appears out of thin air and drops on top of the
                        trays</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Here’s a cake too”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Oh man, I love you guys so much. This will be gone in probably like a day at most haha”
                    </li>
                    <li>Comic pass the food over to Airi</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “I will drop you off at the 30th Street station, that way it is just a short walk
                        back to your apartment”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Sound good”</li>
                    <li>The train speed up and for a bit before slowing down, and even come down to a stop, the entrance
                        door open</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I guess this is it huh”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “I guess it is”</li>
                    <li>[Comic bawl]: “I will miss you Airi”</li>
                    <li>Airi laughs, puts her food down on the bench, and walk up to hug Comic</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I really appreciate all your help Comic, thanks to you I had an amazing time”</li>
                    <li>Airi look over at Astraeus</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Do you hug or…”</li>
                    <li>Astraeus blushes, he averts his eyes and looks at the ceiling</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “You may hug me, mortal, but just know you are hugging a god”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Are you… pulling a tsundere card on me?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “What’s that?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It’s like a personality where… you know what. Nevermind”</li>
                    <li>Airi walks over and hugs Astraeus too, then walks back to the bench and picks up her food, and
                        walks toward the entrance.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Thank you both. I had a lot of fun. If you ever need my help again with anything,
                        please let me know. Tell Mari I said bye, take care of her for me”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Goodbye Airi”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “BYEEEE AIRI”</li>
                    <li>We then cut to the 30th street station, where we see a regular subway but with the inside of the
                        Shooting Star Express when we look through the entrance. Airi walks off it and turns around, but
                        the inside changed back to a regular subway inside, with an old lady looking at her like she
                        just saw a ghost</li>
                    <li>Airi turns around and starts walking to get home, she talks to herself occasionally as she walks
                    </li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Hmm, I wonder how Aoi is doing, Ah I will call him tomorrow”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “This whole trip gave me a lot to think about. Maybe I should visit my parents too, how
                        many vacation days I have left I wonder”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I hope Mari is gonna be okay”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Man, the food is heavy. This is a lot of food… Wait, couldn’t Astraeus just drop me off
                        at my apartment directly…?”</li>
                    <li>We cut back to Astraeus and Comic</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Wait… why didn’t you just drop Airi off at her home instead of the station?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus looks shocked]: “Shit. You are right. I didn’t even think about it”</li>
                    <li>The scene fade to black</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Mari… I really hope you choose to live”</li>
                </ul>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: The Shooting Star Express is also the same in this scene as in Chapter 1.9. Airi will be
interacting with the strange headwear device and machine connected to the wall in the reception room. The device allows
Airi to envision a memory from her past and let her navigate The Shooting Star Express there.

                Comic explains to Airi how she can go about helping Mari. Since Astraeus told Airi that Mari and her are connected and Airi doesn’t recall ever meeting Mari, Airi thinks they might have gone to elementary together and decides to go there.

                <b>[Scene]: Airi looks around the room, confused as Astraeus disappeared even though he entered the
                    train only a few seconds before she did. Just then, Comic enters from the engine room while looking
                    at a chart he’s holding.</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Airi! Here you are. The preparation is...”</li>
                    <li>[Comic pauses and looks at Airi]: “Airi are you okay?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi looks at Comic]: “Yeah. Sorry, I asked Astraeus a question but he went inside and
                        disappeared even though he entered the train only like 3 seconds before I did. He caught me
                        off-guard, that’s all”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Ah. Well, if Astraeus doesn’t tell you, he usually has reasons for it. Don’t worry.
                        Astraeus is a benevolent god. He looks scary because he’s a skeleton, but he really cares for
                        other people and wants to help them.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I see”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Anyway, I do have some stuff to tell you. The preparation is complete. Come this way”
                    </li>
                    <li>Comic walks over to the aforementioned headwear device and machine connected to the wall. Airi
                        follow him</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What is this machine?”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “I’m glad you asked! Ahem… Allow me to explain”</li>
                    <li>[Comic turn over to look at the player and wink]: “You listen too, this is a game mechanic
                        explanation after all”</li>
                    <li>[Airi turns over in the direction of the player]: “Who… are you talking to? You are so freaking
                        weird Comic”</li>
                    <li>[Comic turn over to look at Airi again]: This headwear and machine are what allow you to travel
                        to the past. You put this machine on and try to recall a memory. And once you remembered it, you
                        can use the machine to navigate the Starlight Express to drop you there.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: So I just put it on and try to remember something?”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Yup. It’s more difficult than it sounds though, memories are usually jumbled, and you
                        might need to…”</li>
                    <li>[Comic wink]: “...Slide it around”</li>
                    <li>[Airi glared at Comic]: “...Okay. Thanks… How do I know what to remember?”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “That’s for you to figure out. You probably should ask Mari what she thinks”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: As Comic suggested, the player will need to go talk to Mari to proceed. I also have a
                    plan for the player to be able to explore The Shooting Star Express again and find Astraeus, where
                    they can press Astraeus for more info on who he is, but this will be optional. Mari will be on the
                    bunk bed (same location as the previous chapter).</p>

                <p>[Scene]: Airi talk to Mari</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “How are you feeling?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I don’t know. I’m not sure how to feel about being dead”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I can imagine. I don’t know how I would feel either if I was in your shoes. But I want
                        to help. </li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Thank you”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: Hey listen, this is probably a really stupid question but, do you remember how old you are?</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: I'm not sure, but I think... I'm in my lates 20s? I remember a little bit about spending a lot of 
                        time in university and getting my first job</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: "I see. In that case we are probably around the same age.
                        I asked because Astraeus mentioned we are closely related, but I don’t think we have ever met each other
                        before. I definitely didn’t meet you as an adult since I would have remembered, so if we met it
                        must have been when I was younger. So for starters, if we are the same age I think we could travel to my elementary
                        school to see if you attended there.</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah, I don’t know where else to go anyway, so it’s fine”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Great, let’s go then”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: Mari will now join Airi’s party, and will walk behind Airi wherever she goes. The player
                    can explore the train again or go to Comic to proceed with the game.</p>

                <p>[Scene]: Airi talk to Comic, who is standing near the machine from earlier</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I know where to go now”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Okay, please put this headset on”</li>
                    <li>*Comic place the head device onto Airi’s head*</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Now please think of the destination you wanted to go to”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I'm thinking about…”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: The player will be presented with a 2x2 very simple sliding puzzle minigame meant as a
                    tutorial. To proceed they just need to solve it, in which the sliding puzzle will result in a
                    picture of an elementary school. This represents the memory that Airi is thinking about.</p>

                <p>[Scene]: The head device plays some short tunes, indicating that the destination is acquired.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Good job Airi, I can see on the system that you were able to input a memory. Next up
                        you just need to select the memory on the navigation device and we will take you there.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: As indicated, the player needs to interact with the machine attached to the wall, where
                    basically a selection UI will show up, listing all the destinations that they can visit. Once a
                    memory is unlocked it will *always* available here, so should the player want to replay a section in
                    the future, they can. Since there’s only one memory unlocked right now, that’s where we will go.</p>

                <p>[Scene]: The machine plays a short tune to indicate that the destination is set. The train engines
                    can be heard powering up, and there’s a slight shake.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Dialog]: “Enrouting to… Applewood Elementary School. Preparing for Timejump”</li>
                    <li>We cut to the view outside of the train, where the train started moving. As it picks up speed,
                        THe PA announces again:</li>
                    <li>[Dialog]: “Jump velocity acquired. Entering Timejump”</li>
                    <li>A portal opens up in front of the train, and the train enters it as the scene fade to black</li>
                </ul>

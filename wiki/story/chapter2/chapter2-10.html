<h5>2.10 [Location: Applewood Town Street Views and Airi’s Parent’s House]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: There is no gameplay in this scene. Most of this scene is just Airi and Mari sitting on top
of a moving car, traveling across town. The car ride will be as long as needed for the player to finish Airi and Mari
conversations. The scenery is still undecided, ideally, I want some pretty scenery as the car moves, such as seaside or
forest. The scene will fade to black once it goes into a tunnel. It will fade back to a residential area street, where
the car will slow down and stop in front of Airi’s parents’ house. We do not enter the house in this scene, but the
outside will be a typical American own house, with a small yard in the front (think Family Guy’s house but with a fence
surrounding the house). The detail is left up to the artist to decide as there are no important features needed for
future cutscenes other than a walkway preferably up a stair into the house.

                While sitting on top of a moving car, Airi and Mari have a conversation about Airi’s life after she
                graduates high school. Airi explains to Mari that Airi moved across the country to go to a small liberal
                art college, so it’s highly unlikely that Mari would also be there. Airi asks Mari what she would do
                after she comes back to life, and together they make a promise to meet each other at a bar. Once they
                arrive at Airi’s parent’s house, Mari faints.

                <p>[Scene]: Airi extends her arms and enjoys the wind as it blows through her hair. Mari sit quietly,
                    staring into the distance</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You know. This is actually really nice. I can’t believe I never thought of this before”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yup”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Are you okay?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah. I’m just thinking about my pasts. I almost feel like I could remember who I am,
                        it’s like on the tip of my mind but I just can’t reach it”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Give it some time, maybe you will remember by the time we get to my house”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I hope so”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You better. My high school is probably the last place where you might have connections.
                        I don’t know what else to show you that would be relevant”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “What did you do after you graduate, Airi?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi laugh]: “Do you want to take a guess?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “You went to college?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi grin]: “Oh that’s a cop-out answer. Obviously, I went to college. My parents basically set
                        up my whole life for that. But that wasn’t the answer I was looking for”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “What did you do then?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I got away from my parents. It was hard but I was able to convince my parents to let me
                        go to a small private liberal art college across the country”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Oh wow. Were you happy to get away?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Oh yeah. Getting away from my parents really helped me with my depression and
                        self-esteem. No one is there to tell me I need to work harder every day. No one to tell me that
                        I’m… not good enough”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “That’s good. I’m happy for you Airi”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Thanks! But this is also why I think I can’t really help you after this. I doubt you
                        took the same path that I did, and if you did, I think I definitely would have known, since I
                        was very involved at my college”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I get you. I don’t remember much but I definitely don’t think I did something like
                        that”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Sorry Mari, I think this really was the last memory I can share with you”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Don't worry Airi. You already helped me so much. I was able to remember so much because
                        of you”</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The two sit in silence for a moment</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What are you going to do once this is all over, Mari?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I don’t know. I guess I will choose to live?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Sorry that was a dumb question huh. I mean like, what will you do once you come back to
                        life?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari takes a moment to think]: “I… haven’t really thought that far yet. But I think I would
                        like to take you on your offer”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “My offer?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “If you were serious about it, I would love to hangout with you and have you break me
                        out of my shell, too”</li>
                    <li>[Airi laugh]: “OH. Right. Yes, of course! Absolutely. I will take you to my favorite bar and hit
                        on guys!”</li>
                    <li>[Mari blushes]: “Maybe not that far. I think I was already dating a guy I think”</li>
                    <li>[Airi astonish]: “Wait really? Spill the beans!”</li>
                    <li>[Mari blushes even harder]: “I don’t really remember much, and I swear I’m not saying that
                        because I don’t want to share. I just simply don’t remember”</li>
                    <li>[Airi smile]: “No worries. But you have to promise me you will tell me if you remember, okay?”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “How about this, once I remember, I will tell you when we go to a bar together?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It’s a promise then”</li>
                    <li>Airi reaches her pink out and makes a pinky promise with Mari. The two then sit together in
                        another moment of silence. Airi then pulls out her phone and a pair of headphones from her
                        pocket. She put one of the earbuds in Mari’s ear (which catches Marie by surprise) and put
                        another one into her ears. Airi then put on the piano song Mari was playing on piano but this
                        time it’s a full-on song instead of just a piano cover</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “This song…”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “My favorite song”</li>
                    <li>The two sit quietly and listen to the music for a solid 30 seconds, then the car enters a
                        tunnel, and the scene fades to black</li>
                    <li>The scene fades back to the car moving in a residential area, eventually slowing down to a stop
                        in front of a house. When the car pauses to a stop. Mari give Airi back her earbud and stretch
                        her arm, while Airi jump off the car, turn around and start walking toward the entrance</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>A moment after, Mari also jump off the car, but as she turns around, she notices where she is,
                        she opens her mouth wide at a loss for word</li>
                    <li>[Mari gasp]: “...”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Welcome to my parent’s house Mari”</li>
                    <li>Mari falls to the ground</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I can’t remember if my parents cleaned the house recently or not so I hope you don’t
                        mind if it’s a bit dirty”</li>
                    <li>Airi keep walking without looking back</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You don’t mind right? Mari?”</li>
                    <li>Airi turned around to see Mari on the ground, passed out. Airi runs toward Mari</li>
                    <li>[Airi scream]: “MARI!!!”</li>
                    <li>Scene cut to black (no fading)</li>

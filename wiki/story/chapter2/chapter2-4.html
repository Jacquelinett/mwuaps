<h5>2.4 [Location: Mari’s Flashback and Shooting Star Express]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: Mari has a series of flashbacks at the beginning of this part. Her flashbacks are jumbled
static grey screens with black silhouettes speaking to her. In her last flashback, one of the silhouettes turns out to
be Airi’s wearing a white lab coat, indicating that he is a doctor. Airi, Comic, and Mari are standing near the entrance
when Mari is out of her flashbacks. The Shooting Star remains unchanged for this part, except for Astraeus, who changed
from his regular trench coat outfit into wearing a Hawaiian shirt and beach trunk, sitting on a foldable chair in the
balcony.

                <p>[Scene]: A series of jumbled scenes happens: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A bunch of small silhouettes form a circle around the scene.</li>
                    <li>[Dialog]: “I don’t want to be your friend”</li>
                    <li>[Dialog]: “Ew. No. Stay away from me weirdo.”</li>
                    <li>[Dialog]: “Shinri!”</li>
                    <li>All current silhouettes disappear, a big one appears in the center of the scene.</li>
                    <li>[Dialog]: “Playing a sport will make you better. I’m signing you up for basketball”</li>
                    <li>[Dialog]: “What do you mean you don’t want to? You don’t have a choice”</li>
                    <li>[Dialog]: “Study hard, that’s the only way you can get people to respect someone like… you”</li>
                    <li>Two more silhouettes appear in the scene</li>
                    <li>[Dialog]: “Dr. Takahashi. Your patients are waiting for you”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Dr. Takahashi?”</li>
                    <li>The silhouette in the center reveals itself to be Airi’s dad.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Mari? Are you okay?”</li>
                    <li>We cut to Mari standing at the entrance of the Shooting Star Express, staring at the ground, her
                        eyes are dull. Airi waves her hand in front of Mari, but Mari doesn’t seem to notice it until
                        about 2 seconds later.</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Huh?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Are you okay? You seem… not there”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah. I’m okay. Sorry, I just have some flashbacks and my head hurt”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Maybe you should go lay down for a bit, we have been out for a while, I don’t know if
                        being… well… dead, affect your ability to move around”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Probably not a bad idea”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “You are probably hungry too, Airi surely you are hungry too right? Considering you
                        were literally heading out to get food before you got here”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Oh shoot you are right. I completely forgot about that. Yes, I’m hungry. You probably
                        should eat too Mari”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “I will go prepare some food then, you go lay down Mari. Get some rest”</li>
                    <li>Comic walks to the kitchen</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Can you go with me Airi? I want to talk to you about something”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Yeah, of course”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Gameplay]: The player can now take Airi to sit on the bed, where the next set of cutscenes will
                    happen. Optionally, they can also interact with Comic who’s actually preparing some gear instead of
                    cooking, and ask what he's doing. Comic will reply that he’s preparing to “hunt down the ferocious
                    beasts” and “harvest fierce-colored fruit” to cook with. Airi will roll her eyes and ask him what
                    he’s really making, in which Comic will squint his eye socket and sheepishly respond “Orange
                    chicken”. Airi can also go interact with Astraeus where she will ask him “What the heck are you
                    doing” and if the player pursues the conversation essentially Astraeus will give life meaning advice
                    while looking ridiculous.</p>
                <p>[Scene]: Mari is sitting on the bunk bed, and Airi is standing next to her. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What did you want to talk to me about Mari?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “This is really random but, is your dad a doctor Airi?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “That’s right, how did you know?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I see him in my flashback. He was referred to as Dr. Takahashi and wear a white lab
                        coat”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Ah, that would actually make sense, my dad works at the hospital in the town, so it’s
                        very likely that he has treated you in the past. In that case, why don’t we go to the hospital
                        next?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah, that works for me.”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Great! Do you remember anything else?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Kind of. I don’t remember details but I think I was bullied. I remember hearing people
                        telling me they don’t want to be my friends”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Geez, that’s rough. I’m really sorry”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “It’s okay. OH. Does the name Shinri ring any bells to you?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “No, I don’t think so, why?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Just a name that I remembered in my flashback, not sure why though”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I see, well if you remember more, let me know. But in the meantime, you should rest for
                        a bit. I will go put in our destination”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Okay, let me know when you are done”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Gameplay]: The player can now interact with the headwear device from chapters 2-2 again and play a
                    3x3 sliding puzzle. Once Airi is done, she can go back and ask Mari to go with her. There’s no
                    dialog/cutscene for picking up Mari, she will simply join Airi’s party once the player asks and they
                    can then head to the next destination. A similar but shorter train leaving scene (compared to 2-2) will 
                    play when the player use the machine. Optionally she can ask Comic if the food is ready yet, in
                    which Comic will tell her to go on her “little trip” first and he will have everything ready by the
                    time she’s back. </p>

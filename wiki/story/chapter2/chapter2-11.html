<h5>2.11 [Location: Mari’s Final Flashback/Airi Parent’s House and Aboard the Shooting Star Express]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>:

<p>Unlike previous flashbacks, Mari’s flashback no longer has any jumbled static background (if the artist can make it
    we will try to have it gradually less static per flashback instead of having then not had static). Mari will be
    inside the living room. To the right of the living room is a hallway, with a stair, and further to the right would
    be the study room. South of the hallway is the dining room to the left and the kitchen to the right. Next to the
    stair are two rooms in a corner, one is the storage closet and the other is a bathroom. All the way south is the
    entrance to the house. There is a wall phone in the hallway.</p>
<p>The living room has a fireplace on the left wall, 2 sets of sofas making up the top and right corner, a coffee table
    in the center, and a TV to the south of the coffee table. The north wall has a big shelf with china decoration (and
    really whatever the artist wants :P).</p>
<p>There are two desks in the study room, both have a PC on them (I intend for it to mean one desk for Mari and the
    other desk for her dad) with various books/typical desktop stuff you usually see. There are also bookcases, shelves
    with decorations, decorations in general, and a piano at the center of the room.</p>
<p>The dining room and kitchen are very typical settings. I don't think I need to describe them. Expect a big
    family-style table you can eat at, a shelf/cabinet for silverware/plate/bowl, stoves, sink, etc.</p>
<p>The gameplay happens only inside of the study room, but the player can explore the surroundings to give proof that
    this is in fact Airi’s house since the player will be exploring the same location in the next part.</p>
<p>The Shooting Star Express remains the same in this part, with Astraeus in the balcony (although I might add rooms to
    the Shooting Star Express in the future just to give variety to where Astraeus can be) and Comic in the engine room.

                Mari has a flashback about being inside a house, where it is revealed that it is Airi’s dad’s house, and
                Mari has been talking to Airi’s dad and referring to him also as her dad. Mari woke up with some
                suspicion and asked Airi to take her to another memory involving her parent’s house. While Airi sets it
                up, Mari has a conversation with Astraeus and he decides to join them for the next trip.

                <p>[Gameplay]: Mari wakes up on the sofa in the living room, looking confused. A moment after, the phone
                    rings, and Mari says she probably should pick it up. The player then takes control of Mari and has
                    to pick up the phone, in which the following conversation ensues:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Hello”</li>
                    <li>[Dad]: “Mari? Your mom and I will be home in two hours. Have you done your homework yet?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “No dad. I just woke up from a nap”</li>
                    <li>[Dad]: “Well please do your homework, and once you are done with that please practice the piano
                        and do your practice SAT test”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I know dad, you don’t have to keep reminding me”</li>
                    <li>[Dad]: “I will check your work once you are done. We will also drop by a restaurant for take-out
                        on the way back, is there anything you want?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “The usual is fine, dad”</li>
                    <li>[Dad]: “Sounds good. See you soon”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “See you soon dad”</li>
                    <li>[Mari put the phone down] and says out loud: “I should get started”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: As the dialog suggests, to proceed, the player needs to 1. Have Mari do her homework
                    (interact with Mari’s desk in the study hall), 2. Have Mari do her practice test (interact with her
                    desk a second time), 3. Have Mari practice the piano (interact with the piano). There will be a
                    short fade to black then back between each action, indicating some time has passed. Once Mari
                    finishes all 3 actions, door unlocking noises will be heard, and Mari will stop whatever she was
                    doing and run toward the hallway, where the front door will open and… Airi’s mom and dad walk in.

                <p>[Scene] Mari wakes up in the bunk bed on the Shooting Star Express, Airi is sitting on a chair next
                    to the bed, passed out. Mari tries to move, which wakes Airi up.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “MARI! You are okay”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Hey Airi”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I was so worried, you fainted when we arrived at my parents’ house, I didn’t know what
                        to do and had to ask Comic to help bring you back”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “How long was I out for?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi looks at her phone]: “Maybe 2 or 3 hours?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Huh. Interesting”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Did you have a flashback?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah, I did”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Were you able to remember more?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I did. In fact, I think I have an idea of who I am now, but I need to confirm it. Could
                        we go back to your parents’ house?</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Yeah of course, if you think it would help we definitely can. I have a good memory for
                        it too. I will go set it up, why don’t you stay here and rest some more?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Thank you Airi”</li>
                    <li>Airi starts walking out of the room</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Airi?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Hmm?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “What is it like being a…”</li>
                    <li>Mari pauses, she doesn’t finish her sentence.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Being a what, Mari?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Sorry. I don’t know what I’m saying. Before you input your memory, could you get
                        Astraeus for me?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Sure Mari. I will let him know you want to talk to him”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Thank you”</li>
                    <li>Airi starts walking toward the balcony, where she will notice that Astraeus is leaning against
                        the wall, looking like he has been listening to her conversation, He gives Airi a nod and walks
                        toward the bed, talking with Mari. In the future, I will probably move the bunk bed into a room
                        and have Astraeus wait right outside instead.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: The player can now control Airi again, and to proceed they need to take Airi to the
                    machine to input the final memory, which is a 5x5 sliding puzzle that is a picture of Airi’s house.
                    The player can attempt to listen to Mari and Astraeus' conversation, but Mari will tell them that
                    she would like to talk to Astraeus in private. Once the player finishes the puzzle, Astraeus and
                    Mari enter the reception room.</p>

                <p>[Scene]: Astraeus and Mari walk up to Airi and initiate conversations with her:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “I’m going with you two on the next trip”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Oh? Is something wrong?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Don’t worry Airi. Nothing is wrong. It just if my suspicion about who I am is correct,
                        I need both you and him to do something for me”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Sounds serious. Should I be worried?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari smile]: “Oh no, don’t worry, at most all you need to do is show me a bit more into the
                        future, that’s all”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I see. Well I’m ready to go whenever you are”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Let’s go then”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Lady first”</li>
                    <li>The scene fades to black as the engine starts rumbling.</li>
                </ul>

<h5>2.7 [Location: Applewood’s Zoo]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: Similar to the hospital, I’m not solid on where things should be, there are only a few
things that I specifically want in this part to play out in a cutscene, but otherwise things are left to Chloe to decide
the layout. Ideally, I would like the zoo to loop around so that the player can explore from one end to the next and
then loop back to the beginning to exit without needing to backtrack. The main attractions for the cutscenes would be
enclosures of lions, elephants, and giraffes. The entrance in my imagination also has a water fountain with a wooden
bench in front of it and an ice cream shop stand to the right, both of which will also be used in a cutscene. Young Airi
and a young boy will be in most of the cutscene, going on a date while watching animals.

                Airi and Mari arrive at the zoo, where Mari realizes Airi went on a date here when she was younger. Mari
                suggested that they search separately so as to not intrude on Airi’s more intimate life details. Airi
                observes her younger self’s date, questioning why she even liked the boy she dated in the first place.
                When they are done searching, Airi reveals to Mari that the boy she was seeing here actually dumped her
                the week after so this actually brings back a sore spot for her. Mari forces Airi to enjoy herself by
                dragging her across the zoo and experiencing going to the zoo as is without any worries/concern about
                figuring out who she is.

                <p>[Scene]: A door appears near the entrance to the zoo, in front of the water fountain. Airi and Mari
                    exit from it, and a moment after, from the bottom of the screen a young Airi and a young boy walk
                    up, seemingly talking and smiling. Mari nudges Airi</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Mari winks]: “Oh, I see why you pick this memory”</li>
                    <li>[Airi blushes]: “It...It’s not like that!”</li>
                    <li>[Mari crosses her arm]: “Uh-huh. I believe you. Tell you what, why don’t I let you uh, observe
                        your totally-not-a-date. This zoo seems big enough that we probably should split off so we can
                        cover more ground”</li>
                    <li>[Airi awkwardly nods]: “Okay!”</li>
                    <li>[Mari starts walking off screen]: “Let’s meet back here once we are done. See you in a bit”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: Despite the dialogs implying that the player needs to explore the zoos, the main
                    objective for this part is actually for the player to follow and observe young Airi and the boy. The
                    whole zoo is open up for the player to explore, but to proceed with the story, the player will need
                    to do the following IN ORDER:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Interact with the lions’ enclosure
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airi walks up to her younger self standing next to the boy in front of the lions’
                                encampment. She stood still and observe them</li>
                            <li>A moment passed by without any interaction between young Airi and the boy</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Right. I remember. This was a very awkward date”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “Do you like lions?”</li>
                            <li>[Boy nervously answers]: “YEAH THEY ARE LIKE BIG CATS”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “I see, what’s your favorite anima…”</li>
                            <li>[Boy interrupts young Airi]: “Elephant!”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “A...ah! Nice!”</li>
                            <li>Another moment of awkward silence</li>
                            <li>Airi rolls her eyes</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “What’s your favorite animal Airi?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I like giraffes”</li>
                            <li>Another moment of awkward silence</li>
                            <li>Airi facepalm</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “How the heck did I go home that day thinking this was a great date? Dude, you
                                could like... I don’t know... ask me follow-up questions like why I like giraffes or
                                something. This is so painful to watch”</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Do you want to go see the elephant next?”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “Yeah!”</li>
                            <li>The two leaves and Airi let out a sigh</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Do I really want to see this?”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interact with the elephants’ enclosure
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airi watches as some of the elephants in the enclosure start sucking up water from a
                                small pond</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Oh… right”</li>
                            <li>The elephants start shooting water at everyone, including young Airi and the boy, as
                                well as AIri, who got her clothes wet.</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “COMIC WTF. I thought I can’t interact with the past other than like I don’t
                                know how to open a door or something?”</li>
                            <li>A door to the Shooting Star Express open and Comic poke his head out</li>
                            <li>[Comic]: “Sorry. Uh. The machine has the sensation setting enabled. I can turn it off if
                                you want”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Please do. And dry my clothes too, if possible”</li>
                            <li>[Comic]: “Okay. But let me double-check to be sure, are you sure you want to disable the
                                sensation setting?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Yes. Absolutely. I don’t want to bet wet”</li>
                            <li>[Comic glares at Airi]: “Okay. Well. Don’t ask me to turn it on again then. But I’m sure
                                you will. A little birdy told me so”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I don’t see why I would need to turn it on again. But okay. Thank you Comic”
                            </li>
                            <li>The door closes and Airi walks forward to her younger self and the boy and listens to
                                the conversation</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Whew! That was fun!”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “Yeah!”</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Do you want to hear some elephant facts?”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “Yeah!”</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Did you know you can tell two separate species of elephants apart by their
                                ears?”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “Really?”</li>
                            <li>The boy runs to the left and starts points</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Yup! So look over there, that elephants have rounded and small ears, so it’s an
                                Asian elephant”</li>
                            <li>Boy start running to the right and points</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “This one has much bigger ears, so it’s an African elephant”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “Wow, you know so much!”</li>
                            <li>[Boy smugs]: “They are my favorite animal after all!”</li>
                            <li>[Airi rolls her eyes]: “Alternatively the sign does say what kind of elephants they are.
                            </li>
                            <li>[AIri pulls out her phones]: “Also, that fact is literally the top result when you
                                search ‘elephant fact’ on a Goggle”</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Did you know, their tusks are actually teeth?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “2nd result”</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Did you know that elephants are constantly eating? They need up to 150kg of food
                                per day so they pretty much spend ¾ of their day eating”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “3rd result, word for word”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “Wow you are amazing!”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “No. He just Goggled them before going on this date. Urgh. Young me was dumb”
                            </li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Let’s go check out the giraffe”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “Okay!”</li>
                            <li>Young Airi and the boy leave.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interact with the giraffes’ enclosure
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airi walks up to her younger self and the boy standing next to each other and listens to
                                their conversations.</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Could you wait a bit? I have to go to the bathroom”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “Yeah!”</li>
                            <li>The boy starts walking to a corner of the enclosure and turns, but he doesn’t actually
                                leave to go to the bathroom. Instead, he pulls out his phone and looks at it. Airi
                                notice this and walk over and read the boy’s phone</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Giraffe fac… OH YOU SON OF A GUN. WOW. ”</li>
                            <li>The boy quickly scrolls down the page and then walks back to young Airi. Airi follows
                                him.</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Back”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “That was quick”</li>
                            <li>[Boy]: “Yeah it turned out I didn’t need to go as badly as I thought I did. Do you want
                                to hear some giraffe facts?”</li>
                            <li>[Young Airi]: “Yeah!”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “You know what. I’m going to be an adult here and walk away before I start
                                cursing. Let’s go wait for Mari”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go sit down at the bench in front of the fountain
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airi will make an angry face while sitting on the bench. A moment after Mari enters from
                                off-screen and walk over</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Oh hey you are done already?”</li>
                            <li>Just then, young Airi and the boy also walk in from off-screen. They walk to the ice
                                cream stand and start talking to the ice cream man inaudibly. Mari sits down on the
                                bench next to Airi.</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “You seem angry. Wasn’t this supposed to be a happy memory for you?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “YEAH. It was. I guess.”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Are you okay?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Yes. Sorry. This was, well, it still is a happy memory for me, it just at that
                                time younger me didn’t realize that the guy was just an idiot with a smartphone who can
                                look up fun facts on Goggle.”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “He’s a kid, Airi. Kids that age will do whatever it takes to be cool”</li>
                            <li>[Airi put]: “I know... I know. Look, I’m just upset because he dumped me like a week
                                after okay and I never really got over it”</li>
                            <li>[Mari looks at Airi like she was joking]: “Wait. Really?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari starts laughing, Airi starts blushing]: “Oh wow you are serious. Airi, how old
                                were you when this happened? This must be at least like 15 years+ ago, right? You are
                                still upset over a boy?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi fluster]: “NO…”</li>
                            <li>[Airi resigns]: “Yeah… I guess so. This was very silly of me huh?”</li>
                            <li>The boy and young Airi left the ice cream stand with ice creams in hand. Mari notices
                                the two leaving and smacks Airi on the shoulder.</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Airi, we came here specifically so you could have some fun memories for once.
                                Don’t let something so ridiculous take that away. Come, let see what ice cream the ice
                                cream guy have”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Okay”</li>
                            <li>Airi and Mari stood up and start walking over to the ice cream stand</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Which flavor is good? I saw the younger you walk away with some ice cream. You
                                had some of this ice cream before right?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Yeah, I tried a few ice creams here each time I visited the zoo. I really like
                                the caramel ice cream”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Sounds good to me. Comic?”</li>
                            <li>A door appears and Comic pokes his head out</li>
                            <li>[Comic]: “What?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Can we like, buy these ice cream or something? We want to eat them”</li>
                            <li>[Comic]: “Have Airi eaten these ice creams before?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Yeah, she said she tried a bunch of them”</li>
                            <li>[Comic]: “That’s easy then. Since she tried it I can just make the ice cream from her
                                memories. Here you go”</li>
                            <li>Ice cream appears in Mari and Airi’s hands. They both start eating them.</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Yo Airi. This ice cream is really good”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Really? Mine doesn’t taste like… anything”</li>
                            <li>[Mari leans over, sniffs Airi’s ice cream, and takes a bite]: “What are you talking
                                about? It tastes great. Try mine”</li>
                            <li>[Airi takes a bite of Mari’s ice cream]: “Nope. Taste like nothing”</li>
                            <li>Suddenly Airi has a flashback about Comic saying “Are you sure you want to disable the
                                sensation setting off?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Oh fuq”</li>
                            <li>Airi turn over to look at Comic, who’s glaring at her</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “C...Comic?”</li>
                            <li>[Comic]: “Nope. I’m not enabling it again”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Pretty please?”</li>
                            <li>[Comic]: “Nope. Too late”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Please do it Comic”</li>
                            <li>[Comic]: “I said no”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “FOR FUCK SAKE COMIC JUST DO IT”</li>
                            <li>[Comic jolted]: “Okay! Done. Sorry”</li>
                            <li>[Mari laugh]: “Thank you Comic”</li>
                            <li>[Airi takes a bite of the ice cream]: “Yay. It tastes like caramel now. Thank you Comic”
                            </li>
                            <li>[Comic shakes his head]: “Okay. Well. If you two need anything else. Call me”</li>
                            <li>[Mari yells]: “THANK YOU COMIC. Let’s go Airi!”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Go where?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Explore the zoo, duh. This was supposed to be a fun memory right? Let’s enjoy
                                ourselves”</li>
                            <li>Mari grab Airi’s hand and pull her as the scene fade to black</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>[Mari]: “Nope. I think I have been to the zoo once or twice since I feel a little bit of
                                familiarity here, but otherwise nothing else”</li>

                            <li>[Mari]: “Isn’t this like, your… 7th ice cream Airi?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Uh. No? This is like… my 6th one, I think”</li>
                            <li>[Comic. It is the 7th. I kept track. You know what, why don’t I just give you like 10
                                more so you can stop calling me every time you want an ice cream?”</li>

<h5>2.1 [Location: Applewood - Train Station]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: The train station will be the same as before since this is a continuation of the last scene
from chapter 1. Airi first talks to the fiery skeleton on the train platform, before going back inside the train. It is
a running joke that the fiery skeleton speak with an Australian accent and Airi mispronounce his name

                The fiery skeleton introduces himself to be Astraeus. He explains to Airi and Mari that he’s the God of
                the Shooting Star. Part of Astraeus’s duty as a god is to guide the spirit of the dead to the afterlife.
                He reveals to Mari that she suicided. Due to some unknown reason, Astraeus offers to give Mari a second
                chance at life, provided that she wants to live after she recovers her memories. Since Airi wished for a
                more interesting life, Astraeus brought Airi here to give her “the adventure of a lifetime”. He asks
                Airi to help Mari by taking Mari through Airi’s childhood, revealing that Mari also grew up in Airi’s
                hometown. Airi agrees to help and everyone enters the Shooting Star Express.

                <p>[Scene]: Airi screams. Mari stands still, unfazed. The fiery skeleton wraps his arm in front of his
                    chest, tapping his foot, counting how long it will take for Airi to calm down. After a moment, Airi
                    stops screaming, she turns over at Mari who is now also staring at her.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Why are you not shocked by this?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I mean… we met a talking train conducting skeleton already. This one is basically the
                        same
                        thing but with a fiery skull”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: "You have a point there"</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton]: “I have a name you know”</li>
                    <li>Just then, Comic pokes his head out of the Shooting Star Express’s entrance</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Boss, I got them here. Let me know if you need anything else”</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton look over at Comic]: “Go ready the engine room, I will call for you in a bit”.</li>
                    <li>[Airi glances at Skeleton]: “Ah… you are the boss guy that Comic was telling me about”</li>
                    <li>[Skeleton looks back at Airi and Mari]: “The name is Astraeus, I am the God of The Shooting
                        Stars. You
                        two are here because you both made wishes under my shooting star. How are you lassies doing?
                        Hope train
                        ride wasn’t too shabby for ye”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Wait… are you… Australian?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “A whot?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “An Australian. You know what, never mind. It doesn’t even matter. You say your name is
                    </li>
                    Australius?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Astraeus”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Isn’t that what I said?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Oi, no, you said Australius. It’s Astraeus”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Australius”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus glares at Airi]: “...Okay. Anyway. As the God of the Shooting Star, part of my
                        responsibility is to take the
                        spirit
                        of the dead on my train over there, guiding them to their next lives”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus walks over and kneels down in front of Mari, he warmly smiles at her]: “How are you
                        feeling
                        Mari?”</li>
                    <li>[Mar look down at the ground]i: “I’m… dead, aren’t I”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus put his hand on Mari’s shoulder]: “I’m afraid so”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Ever since I woke up I have had this sinking feeling that something is wrong. But I
                        couldn’t
                        understand why… until now. How did I die?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “You… suicided”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I… I see. I can’t seem to remember anything”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Give it some time. I know it is probably really overwhelming for you at the moment.
                        But you
                        will remember, I promise”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Am I dead too?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus stands up and turns over to Airi]: “No. You are alive. I actually brought you here to
                        ask you
                        to help Mari”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What do you mean?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Due to… ‘extenuating circumstance’ surrounding Mari’s dead, if Mari still want to
                        live
                        after remembering why she suicided in the first place, I will grant her a second chance at life”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Why me? I’m just an office worker”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Well, you asked for a more interesting life, right? I'm giving you the adventure of
                        a
                        lifetime. You
                        get to help someone and get to have fun while doing it.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I… see. So I’m only here because I made that wish huh?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Well, no. Mari actually wished to ‘see’ you as well, you two are actually closely
                        related.
                        But, I don’t want to spoil the fun for you. Do you want to help her or not?”</li>

                </ul>
                <p>[Gameplay]: The player will be presented with a yes or no option on whether they want to help Mari.
                    If
                    the player selects yes, the game will continue. If the player selects no, [Neutral Ending 1: Mystery
                    Not
                    Enticed] happens, where Airi wakes up in bed and figures it was all a strange dream. This chapter is
                    written with the player selecting yes in mind</p>

                <p>[Scene]: Airi roll her eyes, shake her head</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Why not. What do I do now?”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus smiles, he looks over at the Shooting Star Express]: “Comic, is the engine ready?”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Comic pokes his head out of the door again]: “Ready boss!”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus turns over and kneels down to Mari again]: “How are you feeling Mari?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I don’t know. I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel. This is a lot to take in, sorry”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “It’s fine Mari. I can imagine it’s overwhelming for you at the moment. Go lay down
                        on
                        one
                        of the benches. Airi will come to get you when we are ready”</li>
                    <li>Mari look at Airi, Airi give Mari a big smile</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Don’t worry a thing Mari, I will do my best to help you!”</li>
                    <li>Mari thanks Airi, then go inside the train. Astraeus stand up and look at Airi again</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus]: “Comic will explain the detail to you, but basically, you and Mari will travel to
                        your past. Mari grew up in the same hometown as you, so I want you to show her around”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “She grew up in the same town as me? I don’t remember ever running into her. But it not
                        like
                        I
                        know everyone in town so”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus start walking inside the train]: “Let’s get going then”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Wait”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus pause]: “Hmm?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What did Mari wish for? You said she wishes to ‘see’ me, but I don’t think we met each
                        other
                        before”</li>
                    <li>[Astraeus shrug and walk into the train]: “Who knows?”</li>
                    <li>Airi yell “Hey, give me a proper answer” and run inside the train to catch up with Astraeus, but
                        somehow
                        he disappeared.</li>

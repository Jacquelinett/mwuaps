<h5>2.12 [Location: Airi Parent’s House]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: The house is the same as the previous part, but the setting is a bit different. Young Airi and her parents are hosting a high school graduation party, so young Airi has various friends including Dara at the house. There are lots of party decorations, such as a banner that says “CONGRATS SENIORS - CLASS OF 20XX” hanging on the walls, balloons, etc. The older version of her baby brother is also present, and depending on how it would fit with the house design, I want to host part of the party outside in the backyard or something too. At the beginning of the scene, Airi, Mari, and Astraeus arrive just as young Airi’s parents and her brother come home, bringing in food and cakes.

                Airi, Mari, and Astraeus arrive at Airi’s parents’ house. In this memory, Airi’s parents are throwing young Airi a high school graduation party. The house they entered is the same house as the previous scene, which helps Mari confirm who she is. Mari talks to Astraeus while Airi enjoys herself reliving her memory of this party. After a bit, Mari asked Airi if she knows a man named Mark, but Airi doesn’t know. Mari asks if Airi could let her look through some of the future memories using Astraeus’s powers to look for Mark, and Airi agrees.

                <p>[Scene]: A door appears out of thin air. Airi, Mari, and Astraeus come out of it. From the edge of the screen, a car slows down to a stop, and Airi’s parents and her brother exit from it. They walks to the back of the car, opens the trunks, and her brother took out a squared box/container, while her parents took out a few stacked trays with foils on top. They start walking towards the house.</p>
<ul>
    <li>[Aoi]: “Airi! I got the cake. Food is here!”</li>
    <li>Young Airi runs from inside the house toward her brother and grabs the box from him</li>
    <li>[Young Airi]: “Thanks!”</li>
    <li>She turns around and starts yelling</li>
    <li>[Young Airi]: “GUYS, THE CAKE IS HERE”</li>
    <li>A moment of silence as everyone else but Airi, Mari, and Astraeus enter the house.</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Lively party huh”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Yep, lots of good food too”</li>
    <li>[Mari laughs]: “Is that really what’s on your mind right now?”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Yep. I didn’t eat a lot of food earlier after all”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Sure, but you also ate tons of ice cream”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Shhh. This is party food, my parents only buy them for special occasions”</li>
    <li>[Mari smile]: “I know. Don’t worry, I’m just poking fun of you”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “You know?”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Anyway, let’s enter yeah? Lead the way”</li>
    <li>Airi, Mari and Astraeus walk towards the house and enter it, we then cut to the inside of the house, where it is the same house as the previous scene. Inside, Airi run forward, while Mari and Astraeus stood still near the entrance</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Aaaaa. This brings back so many memories. You gotta eat with me Mari the food at this part was amazing”</li>
    <li>Airi pauses as there is no response. She turns around</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Mari?”</li>
    <li>The camera focuses back on Mari, who stood still. We then cut through all of Mari’s flashbacks from earlier chapters, with each of the “dad” silhouettes glitches and becoming Airi’s dad. As a quick reminder so you don’t have to re-read the previous chapters, Airi had 3 flashes back prior to the final one:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1st flashback: The silhouette tells Mari to play sport and said he signed Mari up for basketball</li>
            <li>2nd flashback: The silhouette tells Mari that he’s keeping her in his office and making her do homework because he’s trying to help her</li>
            <li>3rd flashback: The silhouette tells Mari that neither men nor women will like her</li>
        </ul>
    <li>We cut back to Mari standing, her face changed into a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenEyes" target="_blank">“hidden eye”</a> face.</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “...”</li>
    <li>[Mari’s face changes back to normal]: “Coming!”</li>
    <li>Mari starts walking toward Airi</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Are you okay?”</li>
    <li>[Mari forces a smile]: “Yeah! I’m fine. Better than ever actually”</li>
    <li>[Airi smile]: “Really? Were you able to confirm what you were thinking?”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Yep. I remember who I am now!”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “That’s great! I’m happy for you”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Thanks!”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “...”</li>
    <li>Mari]: “...”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “...”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “...”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Okay. I’m going to enjoy myself then. Lots of good foods I want to eat again!”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Sounds good! I’m going to talk to Astraeus for a bit if that’s okay with you”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Oh yeah of course. I’m sure now that you remember who you are, you two have a lot to talk about. I will leave you two alone then”</li>
    <li>Airi walks took a few steps backward, then turn around to face the hallway again</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “I wonder why Mari doesn’t tell me who she is. Ah well, let just enjoy myself”</li>
</ul>

<p>[Gameplay]: To proceed, the player will need to kill some time by exploring around the house, watching what young Airi is doing. If the player attempts to talk to Mari or Astraeus, Airi will just say “I probably should leave them alone”. The following actions will need to be done IN ORDER:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Walk to where the party is happening (which will be done in either the dining room or the backyard depend on whether we decide to have a backyard or not)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Airi’s parents and all her friends gather together at the table, and Airi’s dad (Takeda) holds a camera and tries to get everyone inside of the frame for a picture. Airi’s mom cuts the cakes and slowly puts each slice on a disposable plate. Both Dara and Airi’s brother look at the cake hungrily</li>
        <li>[Takeda]: “Congratulations guys! You guys made it through high school!”</li>
        <li>[Everyone]: “Thank YOU MR. TAKAHASHI”</li>
        <li>[Takeda]: “Enjoy yourself! Eat well and enjoy your summer so that once college starts you can focus and study hard!”</li>
        <li>[Young Airi roll her eyes]: “Don’t be such a party pooper dad”</li>
        <li>Takeda walks over and gives young Airi a lighthearted jab: “Once you graduate college I will apologize for being a party pooper. Anyway enjoy yourself, I will be upstairs if you need me”</li>
        <li>[Young Airi]: “Thanks dad”</li>
        <li>Takeda exits the hallway (or enters the house if this was in the backyard). Everyone starts eating and the music starts playing. The screen fades to black and back to people no longer gathering around</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “I wonder what foods are available”</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Interact with the food on the table</li>
    <ul>
        <li>As you can expect, Airi will call for Comic, who will begrudgingly appear and help feed her.</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “COMIICCCC”</li>
        <li>A door appears, and Comic pokes his head out</li>
        <li>[Comic]: “Say what now?”</li>
        <li>[Airi grins]: “Can you make me some of this cake?”</li>
        <li>[Comic glares at Airi]: “You know, Astraeus is here right? He’s all-powerful he can make you whatever food you want”</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “Yeah but… he’s busy talking with Mari”</li>
        <li>[Comic sighs]: “Fine. Do you just want the cake? Anything else?”</li>
        <li>[Airi grin]: “WELL since you asked, maybe one of every food on the table?”</li>
        <li>[Comic rolls his eyes somehow]: “... Fine. Give me a second”</li>
        <li>The scene fades to black</li>
        <li>[Comic sigh]: “There you go”</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “NOM NOM NOM”</li>
        <li>[Comic]: “Slow down. Are you even enjoying it?”</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “NOM NOM Yes NOM NOM What NOM do you NOM mean?”</li>
        <li>[Comic glare at Airi]: “Nevermind”</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “Can you make me one more of this?”</li>
        <li>[Comic sigh]: “Sure”</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “NOM NOM NOM”</li>
        <li>The scene fades back to Airi sitting on the chair, her tummy is big. She burp</li>
        <li>[Airi smile]: “THANK YOU COMIC”</li>
        <li>[Comic]: “No worries. Do you need anything else?”</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “Nope. I’m very full. Plus I still have the slice of cake. Thank you”</li>
        <li>[Comic]: “I’m off then”</li>
        <li>Comic slam the door and disappear</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “I wonder what my brother is doing”</li>
        <li>From here on, Airi’s sprite will change to her walking around with a plate with a slice of cake.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <li>Walk to the living room where young Airi, Dara, and Aoi (Airi’s brother) are playing Maria Kart.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Airi walk over and sit on the couch and observe the three play video games</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “Oh man. I haven’t played Maria Kart for a while”</li>
        <li>[Young Airi]: “AAAA AOI NO WHY ARE YOU BLUE USING THE BLUE SHELL I’M IN 1ST PLACE I THOUGHT WE AGREED TO TEAM UP”</li>
        <li>[Young Dara]: “I KNEW IT YOU GUYS ARE CONSPIRING AGAINST ME”</li>
        <li>[Aoi]: “Sorry Airi I wanted 1st place”</li>
        <li>[Young Airi]: “That’s it. It’s every man for himself now. Better watch your back Aoi. OI. Urgh. How are you able to hit me with a green shell from behind without looking?”</li>
        <li>[Aoi]: “I don’t know skill I guess”</li>
        <li>[Young Dara]: “Well guess what?”</li>
        <li>[Aoi]: “OH NO”</li>
        <li>[Young Airi]: “DARA NO”</li>
        <li>[Young Dara]: “Get zapped. I win”</li>
        <li>[Young Airi and Aoi]: “NOOO”</li>
        <li>[Airi]: “This brings back memories. Dara and Aoi together. They are trouble when they are teaming up”</li>
        <li>[Airi ponder]: “I wonder what Mari’s sister is like…”</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>[Scene]: Just then, Mari and Comic walk into the rooms.</p>
<ul>
    <li>[Mari]: “Hey Airi”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Hey”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Thank you again for helping me. You helped me so much. Although before I let you go, could you maybe help me with one more thing?”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Yeah sure, what’s up?”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Have you ever met anyone named Mark?”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “I probably met a few Mark in my life, but none off the top of my head. Why?”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Ah okay so it’s not like you dated anyone named Mark right?”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Hmm. I don’t think so. What does he look like?”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “He’s a blonde man, wears glasses, tall I guess. Maybe a bit awkward to talk to?”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “I don’t think I know someone like that sorry”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Ah. I see that’s fine then. In that case, instead, could you let me scan through some of your future memories?”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Scan? What do you mean?”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Astraeus has the power to let us view your memory quickly without needing to go through the process of having you physically travel to the past. We can’t explore since we are still physically here, but it let me quickly go through your life to see if you came across Mark before”</li>
    <li>[Airi glares at Astraeus]: “You had this power this whole time and you didn’t just use it to help Mari?”</li>
    <li>[Astraeus shrug]: “As Mari said, you can’t explore around when doing this, and I think exploring and really just taking your time seeing things at a slow pace help people recover their memories better. Plus I was… busy… doing whatever gods do these days…”</li>
    <li>[Airi squints her eyes]: “Seem awfully convenience”</li>
    <li>[Astraeus squints his eyes]: “Just roll with it will ya?”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “That’s fine then. I don’t mind looking through my college life again. What do I need to do?”</li>
    <li>[Mari]: “Just stand still, Astraeus will do the work”</li>
    <li>[Airi]: “Can I eat my cake at least?”</li>
    <li>[Mari laugh]: “Yeah, of course, take your cake with you”</li>
    <li>[Astraeus]: “Okay. Let’s go”</li>
    <li>Astraeus snaps his fingers, and the surroundings start to change.</li>
</ul>

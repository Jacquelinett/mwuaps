<h5>2.9 [Location: Applewood High School]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>:

<p>Similar to previous scenes, I’m still not 100% sure on how I want the school layout to be, other than it’s American,
    maybe looping around to save on backtracking. There are a few important locations that I will describe, as it is
    important for the scenes, but where these locations go (and really the order in which they connect) is flexible. The
    important locations are locker rooms, field, history class, music class, library, and the school entrance.</p>
<p>The history class is a typical classroom setting, although, unlike the elementary school, this time it is more
    American inspired than Japanese inspired. The teacher desks are actually placed toward the back, behind the
    students. There is a whiteboard to the front, with a projector screen and a podium for when the teachers want to
    speak. The classrooms are decorated with motivational posters and various history props, such as German helmets and
    steam train sets. Young Airi and Dara will be sitting next to each other in the class. There will also be a girl
    named Lara who is also in the class.</p>
<p>The locker rooms are gendered, with a gym teacher’s office in the middle between them. Both locker rooms and the
    teacher’s office are connected to a typical track + grass field behind, which is fenced. The locker rooms are also
    typical American locker rooms, open changing (although there will be a bathroom connected on the side if someone
    chooses to not change in front of other people). The field size is medium size, probably the size of a professional
    basketball court, intended to be multipurpose fields that you can play most sports on despite the size and provided
    the equipment is set up. The track on the outside of the fields is rubberized, similar to a typical track field.</p>
<p>The library will have two rows of computers near the back, two rows of big/group study table to the front, a row of
    bench tables to the left along with the reception desk, and shelves of books to the right.</p>
<p>The music class is very similar in layout to the old elementary school music class - with a piano near the center and
    table/chair set up like a stadium/rounded fashion.</p>
<p>The front of the school, in a typically American fashion, will actually be a drop-off/pick-up road that leads to the
    parking lots. Young Airi and Dara will be waiting at the entrance, talking to each other. During the cutscene,
    Airi’s parents will arrive here in a car, and young Airi will enter the car while Airi and Mari will be climbing ON
    TOP of the car and sit there as the car drives away.</p>

                Airi and Mari explore Applewood’s high school, where they visited: 1. The gym - Mari remembers being
                bullied there and didn’t want to go in. 2. The history class where Mari remembers her best friend Lara
                and has a conversation with Airi about social anxiety. 3. Piano class where Mari remember a tune and
                played it on piano. 4. The library where Mari remembers spending most of her lunchtime there. Once all
                the locations was visited, the school bell rings, indicating classes are over and Airi and Mari head to
                the entrance to see if they can find young Mari in the crowd. Unfortunately, young Mari was nowhere to
                be seen. Instead, they decided to climb on top of Airi’s parents’ car when they arrived to pick young
                Airi up, thinking it would be a fun change of pace.

                <p>[Scene]: Airi and Mari arrive at the high school, where all of a sudden Mari starts shaking and looks
                    visibly distressed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Oh no…”</li>
                    <li>[Airi looks at Mari]: “Mari? Are you okay?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Not this place…”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Do you recognize the school?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Kind of… I have definitely been here before. I can’t remember the detail but being
                        here… make me feel extremely nervous”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Do you want to head back? I don’t want you to feel uncomfortable. I can explore by
                        myself and see if you attended here”</li>
                    <li>[Mari takes a deep breath]: “No. It’s fine. I will be fine. I just need a moment to myself”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Take as much time as you need. Deep breath”</li>
                    <li>[Mari takes a moment to do 3 deep breaths]: “Okay. I’m ready. Let’s go”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: Similar to previous chapters, the player needs to do the following actions in any order
                    unless specified otherwise:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Go to the entrance of the divided locker rooms
                        <ul>
                            <li>As Airi and Mari walk toward the locker room, Mari stops walking, Airi doesn’t notice
                                and keeps walking forward until Mari calls her.</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Airi?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi turns around]: “Hmm?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Could you… check the locker room without me?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Yeah, of course. Are you… okay?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “That place… give me bad vibes. I think I was bullied a lot inside”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Ah. Yeah. I don’t blame you. I saw a lot of bullying happen there”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “It happened to you too?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Fortunately not. But it definitely happened a lot, be it hazing, or just
                                teenage girls being insecure and lashing out. Some people tried to get the teacher to do
                                something about it but a lot of times it was just very hard to prove, and some of the
                                stuff was relatively minor that even if the teacher believed you there wasn’t much they
                                could do.”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Like pouring water on your socks?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Yeah! Like that. If a teacher comes in the person would just plead that it was
                                an accident, but now you have to run around in wet shoes that will give you blisters.
                                Did that happen to you?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I think so… I don’t remember much, and to be honest I don’t want to remember”
                            </li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “It’s okay Mari. Wait here. I will go check”</li>
                            <li>To progress, the player just needs to take Airi inside the locker room, to the field,
                                and run around the track once then back outside. The goal of this part is to show that
                                Mari wasn’t there. There will probably be optional dialogs if Airi interacts with some
                                of the students inside, indicating things like what they are doing in the gym today or
                                things like that.</li>
                            <li>Once Airi is back outside, she looks at Mari and shakes her head</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Sorry Mari, I couldn’t find you”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “It’s okay. Even if I’m not there, being here already help me remember a lot”
                            </li>
                            <li>[Airi shakes her head]: “Regardless, this is really weird that we simply can’t find you
                                anywhere, even though you have been to every location we have been to. Let’s keep
                                exploring”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go inside the history class
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airi and Mari walk into the history classes and scan their surroundings. A moment after,
                                Mari seems to recognize someone</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Hmm, do you recognize anything Mari?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari walks over to a girl at a desk]: “Do you know this girl?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Kind of. I know of her, but I’m not really friends with her. Do you recognize
                                her?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I think so. Her name is Lara, right?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Yup. Were you friends with her?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I… might have been? I don’t fully remember. I can recall some memories with
                                her, like, we would eat lunch together or something like that”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I see. I’m actually quite surprised that you are friends with Lara. She’s a
                                bit… how do I put this, standoff-ish?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “What do you mean?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “She transferred to the school in the middle of my sophomore year. I heard from
                                others that apparently, Lara’s dad is a military officer who travels a lot due to his
                                position, so she also moves school a lot and doesn’t really try to make friends”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Ah. I guess I do remember that”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I don’t really know her though. So she might have been really nice, it just it
                                was very hard to talk with her”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Hmm… I’m almost sure Lara is actually my best friend, although something
                                happened between us and we stopped talking.”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Really? Do you remember why?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Unfortunately no. Honestly… we were both social outcasts, I think that is why
                                we even became friends in the first place. It was just a friendship out of necessity
                                rather than closeness”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I see. Did you two at least hang out sometime despite that?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I think so, it was just… we were both awkward so we didn’t really go out much
                                and just stay home watching shows and stuff”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Honestly? That’s super valid. You might not believe me but I was actually very
                                antisocial before I meet Dara”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Really?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Yeah. I talked to her for the first time ever in this class actually. We know
                                each other since elementary school but it wasn’t until this class that we started
                                talking with each other”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Yeah I remember you telling me a bit about that”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “It was by pure chance, too. This class has an assigned seating chart and it
                                just so happened that we were assigned seating next to each other. On the first day,
                                Dara was like ‘HEY GIRL OMG I ALWAYS SEE YOU BUT WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO TALK’. She’s a
                                very loud person haha”</li>
                            <li>[Mari laugh]: “That does seem like something she would say”</li>
                            <li>[Airi smile]: “Yeah. I was able to break out of my shell because of her. She dragged me
                                on so many of her shenanigans that I had to literally overcome my social anxiety”</li>
                            <li>[Mari chuckle]: “That’s really nice. Honestly, I’m a bit jealous. I have social anxiety
                                and to this day I’m still a bit nervous talking to people”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Maybe you just need a friend to break you out of your mold like Dara did for
                                me”</li>
                            <li>Airi pause for a moment</li>
                            <li>[Airi wink]: “Tell you what. Once this is over. Let’s go to the bar together. I will
                                show you around and even be your wing girl and have you talk to some cute guys eh?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari blushes a little]: “S…Sure. That would be nice”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go inside the music class
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airi and Mari enter the music class, where Mari notices the piano and walks toward it,
                                and sit down while Airi explores the room. Mari started playing a tunes</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Wait… This song”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Do you know this song?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Yeah, it’s *INSERT SONG NAME HERE*. My favorite song, actually”</li>
                            <li>[Mari cries]: “I see… I honestly didn’t even know the name of the song or where it came
                                from. As soon as I saw the piano for some reason I just suddenly remembered how to play
                                this song. I must have practiced this song a lot”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “It’s a beautiful song. It’s a bit melancholy though. But that’s why I like it.
                                It makes me appreciate what I have”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I guess so”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “You played really well, I’m actually a bit embarrassed that I played Canon in D
                                in front of you now. You seem like you play piano so much better than me”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Oh no. I don’t remember anything else but this song. You definitely play better
                                than me right now”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “You are just being nice. But once your memory recovers play the piano for me
                                sometime! Maybe you can even teach me hehe”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Okay. I will keep it in mind”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go inside the Library
                        <ul>
                            <li>[Mari]: “This place… I spent a lot of time here”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Oh? Did you remember something?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I think so. I must have… spend an embarrassing amount of time here. I remember
                                spending pretty much most of my lunchtime in here on the computer doing things”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Honestly, not a bad way to spend your time. It isn’t my first choice but I
                                think it’s nice. Not a lot happening. Peaceful and quiet”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Yep. And hard to get bullied when everyone has to be quiet”</li>
                            <li>[Airi frown]: “I.. honestly didn’t even think of that”</li>
                            <li>[Mari smile]: “I didn’t expect you to. Oddly enough I think I had a lot of happy
                                memories here, I can’t remember why though”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Really? Maybe you read a lot of good books in here?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari laugh]: “Maybe. I don’t think I was much of a reader haha.”</li>
                            <li>[Airi smile]: “You seem really happy right now Mari. It gotta be love. You probably met
                                a guy… right?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari blushes]: “I DON’T REMEMBER I SWEAR”</li>
                            <li>[Airi smug]: “Then why are you blushing?”</li>
                            <li>[Mar frowni]: “I… don’t know. I really don’t remember”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Well, let’s keep exploring, maybe you will remember once you see more”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once all the above is done, the school bell rang and Airi will remarks that everyone is heading
                        out, so they should check the entrance of the school to see if young Mari is there. Head there
                        to proceed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Scene]: Airi and Mari arrive at the entrance of the school and scan around, unfortunately, young
                    Mari was nowhere to be seen.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Okay this is slowly becoming absurd. You have clearly been to every place that we have
                        been to, but why can’t we ever find you?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “It’s okay Airi. Being here was enough to help me remember more about my life”</li>
                    <li>[Airi shake her head]: “Yeah but, I wish I coulda do more. This is so upsetting”</li>
                    <li>A moment of silence passes, and Airi’s parents pull up in a car. Young Airi run toward the car
                        to enter</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Is that your parents Airi?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Yeah, why?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Do you think there are any other places here at the school we should check out?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Hmm. Not really. We have been through all the important places I think. Why?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Great. Follow me”</li>
                    <li>Mari grabs Airi’s wrist and drags her toward her parents’ car. Mari steps on the front of the
                        car and climb up, sitting on the top. She reaches out her hand to Airi</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Get on”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What the fuck are you doing?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Your story about Dara helping you break out of your shell inspired me. I have always
                        wondered what it would be like to sit atop of the car would be like. So I’m going to do it.”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Airi laugh]: “You are crazy. This is dangerous”</li>
                    <li>[Mari laugh]: “I’m already dead”</li>
                    <li>[Airi laugh]: “I’m not. But you know what fuck it. I’m like 80% sure if I call Comic and ask him
                        if it would safe to do this here he would say yes anyway. Let’s do it”</li>
                    <li>Airi grabs Mari’s hand and Mari pulls Airi to the top of the car.</li>
                    <li>Airi and Mari sit still, looking at the sky and scenery as the car start moving</li>
                </ul>

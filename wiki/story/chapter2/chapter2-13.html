<h5>2.13 [Location: Various scenes in Airi’s future, which include her college dorm, a random party, the subway, the
    observatory, random karaoke/bar scene, and a bit of her work tower]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>:
<p>Similar to the car scene, there is no gameplay in this part. This scene is not a single location, but rather a
    multitude of places that get shown one after the other as Airi, Mari, and Astraeus quickly scan through Airi’s more
    recent memories. The trio will stand in one place for the entire duration, but the background changes from one place
    to the next. Note that you won’t actually see any conversations in these scenes, as it meant to be a quick scan
    through and not a detailed view. Throughout this entire scene, for comedic purposes, Airi will just be casually
    eating her cake. Below are the locations that this scene encompasses:</p>
<p>Airi’s dorm room, which will probably just be a typical college dorm with two bunk beds, with a college-age Airi and
    3 other girls.</p>
<p>A party, which will probably be like a typical frat house party, with loud music/disco lighting, lots of people, a
    table with food and drinks against the wall, with college-age Airi awkwardly standing there holding a drink until a
    brunette guy comes and asks her to dance.</p>
<p>The observatory, in which college-age Airi will also go on a date with a guy, where they are on the top floor and
    looking through a giant telescope. The room they are in is a domed room, with a glass ceiling so even if you aren’t
    looking through the telescope, you can still see the sky and stars.</p>
<p>The subway, in which it will be very similar to chapter 1 subway scenes with little modifications.</p>
<p>A park scene with cherry blossoms falling and a bench where Airi and the guy will sit on. Later on, Airi and her
    parents will also be sitting on the bench.</p>
<p>Airi’s workplace, which is the same as chapter 1’s work scene</p>
<p>A bar/karaoke, in which college-age Airi and Dara hang out and get wasted</p>
<p>Airi’s apartment, which is also the same as chapter 1’s.</p>

                It’s a bit hard to describe this scene, but it is essentially like Airi, Mari, and Astraeus watching a
                movie about Airi’s college life and job, but at 10x speed so that Mari can find someone named Mark. It’s
                revealed that Airi never met anyone like that, and the only time she came into contact with Mark was
                that one time on the subway in chapter 1 part 6 where he and Airi accidentally catch eyes on the subway
                and she had a dream later about him. Afterward, the trio head back to the Shooting Star Express

<h5>2.3 [[Location: Applewood Elementary / Airi’s Elementary School]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>:

<p>Airi travels to the past with Mari, visiting her elementary school, where she notices a kid version of herself, who’s
    in second grade in this time period. They arrive at the school entrance, where there is a building in front of them,
    and various playground types of equipment - a sandpit with swing, monkey bars, bouncy horses on the right side.
    There are benches and paved roads on the left side. Kid Airi is sitting against the wall of the building, sipping
    her juices while reading a book. There are 3 girls playing jump rope, one of them being a kid version of Dara from
    chapter 1.</p>

<p>Inside the building is first a hallway, with 2 classrooms on one side, and an stadium and bathroom on the other. One
    of the classrooms will be just for show, while the other one will have a cutscene. The one with the cutscene has two
    boys playing a video game on two Gameboys (jokingly dubbed Gamegirls in the game), and a girl reading a manga. Both
    classrooms are typical classroom settings, with a dark green chalkboard on one side with the teacher’s desk, and
    tall windows that let the students see the outside. The bathroom won’t be important, but there will be a cutscene in
    the stadium. There is a group of boys and girls playing basketball on one side of the court in the stadium and a
    ballrack near by. </p>

<p>At the end of the hallway are the teacher offices and the stair to the second floor. The teacher offices are more
    Japanese-like than American, where teachers have their own cubicles instead. However, due to the scope of the game
    the player won’t be able to explore the teacher’s office, and when the player is in there it will entirely be a
    cutscene. Thus the only important description will be one of Airi’s teacher cubicles, where there will be Airi’s
    parents, Takeda and Yumiko, and kid Airi on one side of the table, and her teacher on the other. If the player tries
    to enter the teacher office, Airi will prevents them, saying "I don't think Mari is in there, let's check other
    place for now"</p>

<p>On the 2nd floor, there will also be another staircase to the 3rd floor. There will be a music classroom in the same
    location as the teacher offices on the first floor (but on the second floor), two more classrooms with no cutscenes
    on one side, and a row of lockers, another no cutscenes classroom (5 classrooms in total, one for each grade) and
    another set of bathrooms on the other. The music classroom will be a typical classroom except the teacher’s desk
    will be moved more toward the center, leaving the corner for a grand piano. </p>

<p>The 3rd floor is very small. There is a small room on the teacher’s office side which is just the storage room that
    isn’t relevant to the story. There will be an exit to the rooftop of the building on the other, and a cutscene will
    happen there. The roof top is pretty much empty, and during the cutscene, kid version of Airi will be sitting down
    against the wall next to the entrance</p>

<p>Obviously, all these details are described because they are important to the scenes. There will be various unnamed
    NPC/kids and teachers the player can interact with but won’t have any significance. At the beginning of this part, a
    door will appear out of thin air, and Airi and Mari will walk out of it. This door is a rectangle shape, with the
    outline kind of like laser cutting through metal showing up first before the portal is open (think of the circle
    outline in Dr. Strange showing up before the portal is open)</p>

                Airi and Mari go to Applewood Elementary school to see if they can find any clues about Mari. Mari remembers that she 
                attended elementary school. Despite being able to find young Airi at the school, they couldn’t find young Mari. Airi and 
                Mari enjoy their time, with Airi having nostalgia about playing BapaMon on her Gamegirl and reading Detective O’Brien. 
                Toward the end, Mari accidentally enters the teacher’s office, where she and Airi listen to Airi’s parents Takeda and Yumiko 
                arguing with Airi’s teacher, asking for Airi to be put in advance classes to prepare her for college despite the fact that 
                she's only in 2nd grade. Airi opened up to Mari a little bit about her family background, how her parents used to push her 
                to do well, but then stopped once her brother was born, due to Asian cultural preference for boys, and instead pushed her 
                brother instead. They return to the Shooting Star Express.

                <p>[Scene]: A door appears out of thin air in front of the schoolyard, and Airi and Mari walk out of it
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “That was… less dramatic than I thought. I figured we would literally park the train
                        somewhere at the school but apparently, we just have a magic door”</li>
                    <li>Mari just nods as she scans her surroundings. Airi also looks around before turning over to look
                        at Mari</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Well? Do you recognize anything?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I… I think so, this school does seem very familiar. I think I might have attended here”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Off to a good start!”</li>
                    <li>Airi takes another look at her surroundings and notices her younger self. Airi walks over and
                        Mari follows her. </li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Well, I see myself here. So if you attended the school maybe kid version of you will be
                        around too”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I will keep an eye out”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Let’s explore then”.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: To proceed with the story, the player will need to explore and perform various actions
                    indicated below in any order (unless specified otherwise). The player can also optional interact
                    with kid Airi again and have Airi make various remarks like “I could have sworn I thought I was
                    taller”. The actions to proceed are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Interact with any of the girls playing jump rope in the schoolyard:
                        <ul>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Do you recognize the girl with the puffy hair?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I think I recognize her, but I don’t think I ever really interacted with her”
                            </li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Really. That’s surprising. That’s Dara, my best friend actually. She’s a super
                                popular girl, even back in elementary school”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Dara? Right. She went to Applewood High School too, right?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “That’s right! So you *are* from around here. I’m kind of surprised we don’t
                                know each other since I was fairly outgoing in school.</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Sorry, I can’t remember the details but I think I was a bit of a loner. I can’t
                                recall having more than maybe 1 or 2 friends”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Ah. Well, we can be friends! You might not believe me but I was actually a
                                loner too for a while. Despite being in school with Dara since Kindergarten, I never
                                actually talked to her until we by chance sat next to each other in high school. She’s
                                so outgoing that she broke my shell and got me to hang out with people more”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I see”</li>
                            <li>[Mari mumble]: “I can’t remember… Who was my friend…?”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter the stadium:
                        <ul>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Oh man this brings back memories. I was never good at basketball but it always
                                seemed so fun to play. Watch this!”</li>
                            <li>Airi runs toward the ball rack, grabs a ball, dribbles as she runs toward the basket,
                                and shoots the ball. The ball hit the backboard and bounced off. Mari catches the balls.
                            </li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Aw…”</li>
                            <li>Mari dribbles the balls, does a three-pointer shoot, and scores.</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Wow Mari, you are good! Do you play?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I… can’t remember. I don’t think so, I may have played in school here and there
                                but I don’t think I play on a team if that is what you meant. It was probably beginner
                                lucks”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Still. That’s super awesome yo. I admire women’s basketball so much so I still
                                think it’s super cool that you play at all.</li>
                            <li>[Mari mumble]: “Basketball huh? Why do I feel… angry?“</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter the classroom with 2 boys playing GameGirl and a girl reading manga:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airi run to the 2 boys and watch one of the boy’s screen</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “YOOOO. GameGirl, I haven’t seen these since… forever. AaaaAaaa they are playing
                                BapaMon. I didn’t have the game on my old GameGirl but my parents got it for me on my
                                Wintendow DS</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “...BapaMon?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “*GASP* You don’t know? It’s Backpack Monster! It was super popular back in the
                                day, they even make anime and manga! Every kid was obsessed with it”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Ah right. I do remember that, but I don’t think I was ever into it though”</li>
                            <li>Airi notices the girl reading the manga and runs toward her. Airi look at the manga
                                cover</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Oh shit she’s reading Detective O’Brien. My favorite manga. Aaaaa.”</li>
                            <li>Airi turns over to look at the window and run toward it. She takes a moment to admire
                                the view.</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “This is going to be a great journey for me Mari. I get to help you AND
                                experience my childhood all over again. I really appreciate this.”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I’m glad. I appreciate your help too”</li>
                            <li>Mari look around</li>
                            <li>[Mari mumble]: “It is very nostalgic… and… sad? Why do I feel sad?”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go inside the music classroom and interact with the piano:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Airi sits down and plays a very short Canon in D. She turns over and gives Mari a big
                                grin.</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Aaaand that’s the extent of my piano knowledge”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “That’s pretty good Airi”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Thanks, you flatter me! My parents forced me to learn piano when I was young so
                                I know how to play a bit. But I was never really into it though so I’m not very good. Do
                                you play?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I think I play a little, but I can’t recall much at the moment” </li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I’m sure you are very good Mari, you look really smart so”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Thanks Airi”</li>
                            <li>[Mari mumble]: “Piano huh?”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once all of the above is done, a cutscene will trigger when the player is near the teacher’s office.
                        <ul>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I can’t seem to find kid you anywhere”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I don’t see myself either. Let's check this room?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I don’t think you will be in there. That’s the teacher’s office”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I will check just to be safe”</li>
                            <li>Mari starts walking toward the teacher’s office.</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Wait. Don’t”</li>
                            <li>Mari stops and looks over at Airi, confused</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Sorry. Something happened to me there and… I’m reluctant to see it again”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “We don’t have to. Whatever makes you comfortable”</li>
                            <li>[Airi takes a deep breath and sigh]: “No, it’s okay. We can go in there”.</li>
                            <li>Airi walk in front of Mari and open the door, they both enter as the scene fade to black
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Scene]: Airi’s parents, Takeda and Yumiko, are arguing with Airi’s teacher to put Airi in advanced
                    classes.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>[Teacher]: “With all due respect, Mr. Takahashi, Airi is in 2nd grade. There’s no reason why a
                        kid her age should be learning algebra and preparing for college entrance exams.</li>
                    <li>[Takeda]: “You don’t understand. Nowadays colleges are very competitive. For Airi to stand a
                        chance at all to go to a Fern League like Harbard and Yeile, she’s already late and needs to
                        work harder. Some of my relatives started their children earlier”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Geez. Your parents… they are something else”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Yeah…”</li>
                    <li>[Yumiko]: “Can you at least put her in advanced courses?”</li>
                    <li>[Teacher]: “We don’t offer any advance level courses here but, I guess I can assign her extra
                        homework from higher-grade”</li>
                    <li>[Takeda]: “That would be fine with us”</li>
                    <li>[Teacher]: “Then I will do that. But I should note that I am unhappy about this. Children should
                        be allowed to be children”</li>
                    <li>Kid Airi started crying and then run out of the room</li>
                    <li>[Yumiko]: “Airi!”</li>
                    <li>[Takeda]: “Leave her be. She’s too young to understand it but we are doing it to help her”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Airi…”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Don’t worry. I’m fine, let’s go after her. If I remember correctly, I went to the roof
                        back then”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>[Gameplay]: To proceed, the player will need to go to the roof. If the player attempts to enter the
                    teacher’s office again, Airi will mention that she doesn’t want to see that memory again.</p>
                <p>[Scene]: At the rooftop, Airi and Mari sit down next to kid Airi, who is just staring up at the sky.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Are you okay Airi?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Yeah. I’m fine. Despite what it looked like, it wasn’t so bad. My parents pushed me
                        very hard for a while, but after my brother was born, they basically stopped caring, focusing on
                        me, and instead pushed my brother instead”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Oh?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Yeah. They are Asian and in our culture, we value boys more than girls. My parents are
                        like that too, when my parents expected my brother to be successful and take care of them
                        instead of me. So I guess in a way it worked out since once I got to high school, I had more
                        freedom to pursue my own hobbies instead of having to prepare for college all the time”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “That’s good at least. What are your hobbies then?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Hehe. I like fashions and watching Korean dramas. What are your hobbies, Mari?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I… don’t remember”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Ah. Sorry, I didn’t mean to put you on the spot”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “No, it’s fine. I just… can’t remember at the moment. I will tell you once I remember”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Regardless, I’m sorry we couldn’t find any hint of you here Mari”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “You have done enough Airi, because of this trip I remember a bit of my childhood, so
                        even if we couldn’t find myself here I’m sure if we keep trying we will be able to. If anything,
                        I’m sorry you had to relive some of your unpleasant memories”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I’m fine Mari. I got to experience a lot of fun this trip, so a bit of sad memory here
                        and there doesn’t bother me”</li>
                    <li>Airi and Mari sit in silence for a moment</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I don’t know how kid me do it. I used to just sit up the roof here when I was sad and
                        stare at the sky for even an hour at a time. I’m bored already and we have only been here for
                        like 5 minutes”</li>
                    <li>[Mari chuckle]: “It is nice though, to just sit back and do nothing sometimes. But do you want
                        to head back then?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Yeah. Although... I didn’t think about this before but… how do we get back? The door
                        disappeared earlier right? COMIC?”</li>
                    <li>Just then, a portal door open on the rooftop and Comic pokes his head out, asking “Yes?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Comic! You can hear us?”</li>
                    <li>[Comic]: “Yes…?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Wait have you been listening in on our conversation?”</li>
                    <li>[Comic turn over to look at the player]: “Don’t worry, I’m ‘programmed’ to only listen whenever
                        someone says my name. So I didn’t hear a thing”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Okay then. Well, we want to head back now”</li>
                    <li>Airi and Mari walk over, but as Mari enters, Airi turns around, runs toward her younger self,
                        and give kid Airi a hug.</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Things will get better. Hang in there”</li>
                    <li>Airi enters the door and it disappears. The scene fade to black.</li>
                </ul>

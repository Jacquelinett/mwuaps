<h5>2.5 [Location: Applewood Hospital]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: <p>I’m actually not 100% sure how I want the hospital layout to be like, so this might be
    subject to change in the future. Airi and Mari will arrive through the portal door in the lobby of the hospital,
    where
    there will be a reception desk to the right with a nurse on staff. The side of the wall has an elevator that can
    take
    them to 3 different floors (including the current one) and the basement. There will be a hallway on the right side
    that
    leads to many treatment rooms. The second floors include several doctor offices, a common lounge with toys (place
    for
    employees’ children and patients’ children to play), and another hallway to the right with treatment rooms, but none
    of
    it will be important to the story and exists purely for easter eggs and exploration. There will however be an
    employee-only office near the end of the hallway, where a cutscene will occur. On the 3rd floor there will also be
    many
    doctor offices, but only one of them, Dr. Takahashi’s office, will be important. The basement is a surgery wing,
    with a
    waiting area and a door to a hallway that leads to various surgery rooms. There will be a cutscene in the waiting
    area
    that spans into one of the surgery rooms that is initially inaccessible due to surgery in progress.</p>

<p>The staff’s lounge has a cabinet full of candies inside, some toys, and various office equipment you would expect in
    a typical hospital - a coffee machine, printer, TV, cabinet full of instant foods like cups of noodles. Dr.
    Takahashi’s office is also a typical office, except there’s an extra desk with various college entrance exam prep
    books. During the cutscene here, young Airi will be sitting at the desk, studying, while her dad works on the
    computer at his desk. The waiting area and the surgery room in the basement are typical rooms you can find in a
    hospital. During the cutscene there, young Airi and her dad will be waiting in the waiting room. A doctor will come
    out to inform them of the outcome of the surgery, and they follow the doctor to the surgery room, in which Airi’s
    mom is laying in bed resting, and a baby is wrapped in a blanket in a basket nearby.</p>

                Airi and Mari visit Applewood hospital in the past when Airi’s little brother was about to be born. Once
                again,
                Airi and Mari couldn’t find a Mari anywhere, but Mari could recall more details about her life. Like
                Airi, Mari’s
                parents also apparently worked at the hospital, so they both have spent a lot of their childhood
                weekends at the
                hospitals. When Airi and Mari enter the delivery room, Mari was able to recall that she had a sister,
                and they
                bond over their similar past. Mari tried to remember more about her sister, but the only thing she
                couldn’t
                remember was herself crying. Afterward, Airi and Mari return to the Shooting Star Express.

                <p>[Scene]: The Shooting Star Express transportation door appears in the middle of the hospital lobby,
                    and Airi and Mari walk out from it. A moment after, the front door/hospital entrance opens, and
                    young Airi and her dad enter, walk to the elevator, and go upstairs as Airi stares at them while
                    Mari just scans around the room. The elevator door closes and Mari starts talking to Airi.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Never thought I would be back here again”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Oh? Is that a good or bad thing?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Honestly, I don’t know, I have a lot of mixed feelings about this place. Some good,
                        some bad, well, mostly bad I guess”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I see, do you… want to head back? I really appreciate your help but I don’t want to
                        trouble you if this is going to cause emotional pain”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Oh no, it’s really fine. It’s complicated, but I will be fine”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Do you want to talk about it?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I’m not sure where to even start. Let’s just explore, for now, I will explain to you on
                        the way. Does any of this make you remember anything so far?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Hmm, I definitely have been here before, this place feels very familiar”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “That’s good at least, let’s walk around to see what we can find”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: Similar to the school section, the player will need to explore and perform various
                    actions indicated below in order. There will be various optional dialogs but not required to proceed
                    that can give more tidbits, such as if the player interacts with the receptionist/nurse, Mari will
                    recognize the nurse working there; or if the player interacts with any of the kids in the lounge,
                    Mari will remark that she vaguely remember playing in here when she was young. If the player tries
                    to enter Dr. Takahashi’s office before the lounge, Airi will just remark “Hey, let’s not go in here,
                    I’m not ready… yet”.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Enter the staff’s lounge
                        <ul>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Hey, I recognize this room</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Are you sure? This is the staff lounge unless your parents worked here, I don’t
                                think you would be allowed in here</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Yeah I think so, I remember coming in here to scourge for instant noodles haha”
                            </li>
                            <li>[Mari walk over to open one of the cabinets]: “Yup, here it is”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I’m surprised. It is really weird then that we don’t know each other,
                                considering your parents’ worked here too”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I don’t think I spent a lot of time here, in fact… I think I mostly tried to
                                avoid people when I was here. I can’t remember why though, only that I didn’t want to be
                                seen. I did sneak in here a lot to steal candies haha”</li>
                            <li>[Airi laugh]: “Yo same, my parents wouldn’t let me eat candies at home so I try to sneak
                                in here as much as I can. The nurses always keep it stocked to give it to kids as a
                                reward for getting shots and such. What’s your favorite candy?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari thinks]: “Probably CitCat”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Wow. Great choice. CitCat is my favorite too actually. I really want one now
                                but I guess I should save my tummy for Comic’s cooking, he seems really excited to cook
                                for us so I want to keep an open mind”</li>
                            <li>[Mari laugh]: “Not a bad idea”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Well regardless of the reason, I hope I don’t make you feel like you need to
                                hide right? I can’t say I felt that way but I have gotten anxious and nervous around
                                large groups of people before so I understand. I’m here to help so if you need space I
                                can leave you alone”</li>
                            <li>[Mari smile]: “Thank you Airi, that’s very thoughtful of you. I feel fine right now, we
                                can keep exploring”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter Dr. Takahashi office
                        <ul>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Hmm, this is your parents’ office… right?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Yeah, why?”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Oddly enough, I felt like I spent a lot of time here before”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Are you sure you didn’t mistake this room for another doctor’s? Most of the
                                offices have a very similar layout”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Maybe, I don’t know. It is still jumbling in my head”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I don’t mean to doubt you, but I spent A LOT of time here, so if you spent any
                                time here at all, I would know”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Sorry, you are right, I probably got this room mixed up with some other room”
                            </li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Nothing to apologize for, I didn’t mean to sound so negative either, sorry. I
                                just… have a lot of pent up anger within this room”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Oh?”</li>
                            <li>Airi walk over to her desk and touch it and let out a sad smile</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Since this is the only hospital in town, my parents often work long hours and
                                irregular hours too to accommodate patients. They work on Saturday and take Thursday
                                off, and occasionally when there are emergencies, they work on Sunday too. I was a kid
                                back then who couldn’t be left home alone, so they took me here, make me do my homework,
                                and make my prep for college”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Geez, that sounds horrible Airi. Couldn’t your mom have stayed home to take
                                care of you?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “She could, but there was just a lot of work to be done, if my parents weren’t
                                seeing a patient, they would be filling out the documentation to keep a record of what
                                they did, filing insurance claims, and all that. They also just really like money so
                                they take on a lot of work even when they don't have to.”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I’m really sorry to hear that”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “My parents immigrated here from Japan and carried the scarcity mindset over.
                                They are always worried that something bad will happen, maybe a natural disaster will
                                occur, maybe an accident will happen, and so they work extra hard to keep more money
                                saved. I get it. I really do understand where they are coming from. But it was just…
                                hard on me as a kid”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I can imagine. I’m really, really sorry that you went through all that Airi”
                            </li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “It’s fine, I’m sorry things got really heavy”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “It’s fine. Surprisingly… I could relate. I don’t remember the details but I
                                think I was in a similar boat too. I think my parents were also immigrants and work long
                                hours so I spent lots of time here”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Seem like we have a lot in common huh”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I guess so. Maybe this is why Astraeus paired us up since with so many
                                similarities you definitely help me remember more about my past”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I’m glad to be of help. Let’s keep going then. I’m sure you will recover your
                                memory in no time”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once both of the above are done, Airi will remark that “Hmm it should be about now”. We cut to a
                        scene of Dr. Takahashi receiving a call, telling Airi then they both run out of the office, to
                        the elevator then down to the basement. The player can then enter the waiting area, where a
                        cutscene will occur.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Scene]: Young Airi and her dad wait in the waiting area, a moment after, the hallway door opens, and
                    a doctor exits, and young Airi and her dad stand up and quickly walk over. The doctor will be saying
                    things to the two, but there is no visible dialog for the player to read. A moment after, young Airi
                    and her dad follow the doctor, and Mari and Airi follow them. The scene fades to black and fades
                    back to young Airi and her dad in the delivery room, both wearing a hospital gown, cap, and mask.
                    Takeda walks up to Yumiko and holds her hand, while young Airi runs over to look at the baby with
                    excitement. Airi and Mari stand nearby, leaning against the wall, silently observing. Airi smiles
                    melancholically.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Mari look over at Airi]]: “Happy memory huh”</li>
                    <li>[Airi smile]: “Yeah, this was pretty much the one thing that redeems my whole experience here.”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “What was your brother’s name? Were you close with your brother?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It’s Aoi. And kind of. We weren’t close in the traditional sense like we didn’t really
                        talk a lot or share common interests. But he… because he’s a son, my parents were a lot harder on
                        him than they were on me.</li>
                    <li>[Mari smile]: “Aoi is a cute name! And I can imagine”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I thought I had it tough, but my parents were even harsher on my brother. After my
                        brother started grade school, my mom actually took a lot of time off, not to spend time with my
                        brother but to take him to cram schools, extra classes, and sports. He had to do so much, I don’t
                        know how he was able to do it. The closeness we shared was the silent understanding of our
                        struggle”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I… I don’t even know how to respond Airi. That’s really rough”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Don’t worry, I’m just sharing. I honestly thought that… well… he would off himself at
                        one point”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “How is your brother now?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “He’s fine now. After my brother got into a prestigious college my parents let him off
                        the leash. He’s doing a lot of therapy, but he’s better. He seemed happy when I last talked to him.
                    </li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “That’s good at least”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Yup. I know my parents did it out of love, but god I really wish they realized how much
                        stress and pressure they put on us. Yeah, we were successful academically, but we were
                        miserable. I think I would have been a lot happier than I am now had my childhood turned out
                        differently”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “What do you mean?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I… just can’t seem to have any ambition in life. My parents pushed me so hard that I
                        just… don’t really care anymore. I don’t want to think about career advancement, I don’t want to
                        think about how to be better, I just want to enjoy my life, and I take it to the extreme
                        sometimes. You are lucky Astraeus caught me on a good weekend haha. I and Dara went to a bar
                        last weekend and I got sooo drunk. I think my hangover was so bad I took 2 days off in a row
                        because my head was still hurt when Monday came. Now that I ‘satisfied’ my parents, I’m trying
                        to find what satisfies me, and right now it means going out every Friday night and getting
                        wasted.</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I can understand why you feel that way. I don’t think I can relate to that, but I
                        understand where you are coming from. How’s your relationship with your parents now?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “We are on good terms. I visit my parents once in a while. We get along so that’s really
                        all that I can ask for. I used to be angry at them but I can’t seem to stay mad, they paid for
                        my college and despite how much pressure they put on me, they did it out of love”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “That’s good at least. How about your brother? How does he feel about your parents?”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “I… I honestly don’t know. He had it so much worse than me I was too afraid to ask”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Make sense, sorry I was just curious”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “You are fine. If anything I’m sorry, I can’t imagine watching me meet my brother for
                        the first time is very helpful for your memory haha”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Oh no, on the contrary actually, being here and hearing your story actually helped me
                        remember a lot. I remembered that I actually have a sister and that I’m pretty sure my parents
                        pushed me very, very hard too. I don’t remember the detail but I’m pretty sure I even pursued my
                        PhD because of my parents”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Geez, you got a PhD huh? What a try hard”</li>
                    <li>[Mari blushes]: “Haha, I just did it because my parents expected it of me”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Still, that’s really impressive though. I can imagine your parents must have placed so
                        much pressure on you, maybe as much as my brother even since when we last talked he was talking
                        about applying to PhD program next”</li>
                    <li>[Mari chuckle]: “Really? Well, once we are done and I come back to life, tell him to reach out
                        to me”</li>
                    <li>[Airi smile]: “Will do!”</li>
                    <li>A moment of silence</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Were you close with your sister?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari takes a short pause]: “Hmm… were I close with my sister?”</li>
                    <li>We see a very short flashback of Mari crying. We cut back to Mari putting her hand on her head,
                        indicating she’s in pain</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Are you okay?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah sorry, I thought I remember something but… it doesn’t make sense”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What did you remember?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I see myself crying”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “While thinking about your sister?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah, that’s why I don’t think it makes sense. Sorry other than that I couldn’t recall
                        much”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It’s okay. Let’s head back. I think we explored most if not everything now. Plus I’m
                        starving, let’s see what Comic has for us.</li>
                    <li>[Mari still had her hand on her head]: “Yeah, let’s head back”</li>
                    <li>Airi and Mari exit back to the waiting area</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Comic?”</li>
                    <li>Similar to previous scenes, a door will appear out of thin air and Comic pops his head out, but
                        this time he has a chef hat on his head. Comic gives them a grin and says “Come on in!” and Mari
                        and Airi enter as the scene fades to black.</li>

<h5>2.5 [Location: Applewood Hospital]</h5>

<b>[Scene Description]</b>: <p>I’m actually not 100% sure how I want the hospital layout to be like, so this might be
subject to change in the future. Airi and Mari will arrive through the portal door in the lobby of the hospital, where
there will be a reception desk to the right with a nurse on staff. The side of the wall has an elevator that can take
them to 3 different floors (including the current one) and the basement. There will be a hallway on the right side that
leads to many treatment rooms. The second floors include several doctor offices, a common lounge with toys (place for
employees’ children and patients’ children to play), and another hallway to the right with treatment rooms, but none of
it will be important to the story and exists purely for easter eggs and exploration. There will however be an
employee-only office near the end of the hallway, where a cutscene will occur. On the 3rd floor there will also be many
doctor offices, but only one of them, Dr. Takahashi’s office, will be important. The basement is a surgery wing, with a
waiting area and a door to a hallway that leads to various surgery rooms. There will be a cutscene in the waiting area
that spans into one of the surgery rooms that is initially inaccessible due to surgery in progress.</p>

<p>The staff’s lounge has a cabinet full of candies inside, some toys, and various office equipment you would expect in
    a typical hospital - a coffee machine, printer, TV, cabinet full of instant foods like cups of noodles. Dr.
    Takahashi’s office is also a typical office, except there’s an extra desk with various college entrance exam prep
    books. During the cutscene here, young Airi will be sitting at the desk, studying, while her dad works on the
    computer at his desk. The waiting area and the surgery room in the basement are typical rooms you can find in a
    hospital. During the cutscene there, young Airi and her dad will be waiting in the waiting room. A doctor will come
    out to inform them of the outcome of the surgery, and they follow the doctor to the surgery room, in which Airi’s
    mom is laying in bed resting, and a baby is wrapped in a blanket in a basket nearby.</p>

                Airi and Mari visit Applewood hospital in the past when Airi’s little brother was about to be born. Once again, 
                Airi and Mari couldn’t find a Mari anywhere, but Mari could recall more details about her life. Like Airi, Mari’s 
                parents also apparently worked at the hospital, so they both have spent a lot of their childhood weekends at the 
                hospitals. When Airi and Mari enter the delivery room, Mari was able to recall that she had a sister, and they 
                bond over their similar past. Mari tried to remember more about her sister, but the only thing she couldn’t 
                remember was herself crying. Afterward, Airi and Mari return to the Shooting Star Express.

                <p>[Scene]: The Shooting Star Express transportation door appears in the middle of the hospital lobby,
                    and Airi and Mari walk out from it. A moment after, the front door/hospital entrance opens, and
                    young Airi and her dad enter, walk to the elevator, and go upstairs as Airi stares at them while
                    Mari just scans around the room. The elevator door closes and Mari starts talking to Airi.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Well we saw you, but I don’t see myself anywhere here either. I definitely have been
                        here before though, this place feels very familiar”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It is the only hospital in town. You definitely have been here before if you lived in
                        the town. Let’s explore around, maybe you were in one of the treatment rooms”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Gameplay]: Similar to the school section, the player will need to explore and perform various
                    actions indicated below in any order (unless specified otherwise). There will be various optional
                    dialogs but not required to proceed that can give more tidbits, such as if the player interacts with
                    the receptionist/nurse, Mari will recognize the nurse working there; or if the player interacts with
                    any of the kids in the lounge, Mari will remark that she vaguely remember playing in here when she
                    was young. But to proceed, the list is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Enter the staff’s lounge
                        <ul>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Hey, I recognize this room</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Are you sure? This is the staff lounge unless your parents worked here, I don’t
                                think you would be allowed in here</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Yeah I think so, I remember coming in here to scourge for instant noodles haha”
                            </li>
                            <li>[Mari walk over to open one of the cabinets]: “Yup, here it is”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I’m surprised. It is really weird then that we don’t know each other,
                                considering your parents’ worked here too”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I don’t think I spent a lot of time here, most of my memories were just
                                sneaking in to take food... mostly candies haha</li>
                            <li>[Airi laugh]: “Hey same!”</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enter Dr. Takahashi office
                        <ul>
                            <li>[Mari]: “This… this is your parents’ office isn’t it?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “Yeah… could we actually not look in here? I spent a lot of time here so if you
                                were here I would know”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Yeah, of course, are you okay?”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “I am fine, it just brings back bad memories for me.”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “Do you want to talk about it?</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “No, not really, it's not worth getting into right now.”</li>
                            <li>[Mari]: “I understand”</li>
                            <li>[Airi]: “We can still look around, but I don’t want to spend much time here</li>
                            <li>Despite what Airi said, the player can still take their time exploring the room, Mari
                                will make some remarks about various things in the room, with foreshadowing about who
                                she is.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once both of the above are done, Airi will remark that “Hmm it should be about now”. We cut to a
                        scene of Dr. Takahashi receiving a call, telling Airi then they both run out of the office, to
                        the elevator then down to the basement. The player can then enter the waiting area, where a
                        cutscene will occur.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>[Scene]: Young Airi and her dad wait in the waiting area, a moment after, the hallway door opens, and
                    a doctor exits, and young Airi and her dad stand up and quickly walk over. The doctor will be saying
                    things to the two, but there is no visible dialog for the player to read. A moment after, young Airi
                    and her dad follow the doctor, and Mari and Airi follow them. The scene fades to black and fades
                    back to young Airi and her dad in the delivery room, both wearing a hospital gown, cap, and mask.
                    Takeda walks up to Yumiko and holds her hand, while young Airi runs over to look at the baby with
                    excitement</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>[Mari chuckle]: “Well I am definitely not in this room”</li>
                    <li>[Airi smile]: “Sorry, my brother being born is basically the only happy memory I have at the
                        hospital so I wanted to see it again”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Oh?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Yeah. I… spent a fair amount of my time in my childhood in the hospital since my
                        parents work here. They didn’t want to leave me home alone so it meant after school they took me
                        here. Sometimes my parents work weekends too so I even have to spend some of my weekends here.”
                    </li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Ah…”</li>
                    <li>[Mari pauses for a second]: “You know what, I vaguely remember similar things happened to me. I
                        could have sworn I spend a lot of time at my parents’ office too”</li>
                    <li>[Airi raises her eyebrows]”: “Really?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah. I think my parents also worked here, but I can’t remember the details.”</li>
                    <li>[Airi laugh]: “You know the more I learn about you the more mysterious you become. Maybe you are
                        me, just from a parallel universe or something”</li>
                    <li>[Mari laughs]: “That might very well be. Although… I don’t remember having a brother. I think I
                        have a younger sister instead”</li>
                    <li>[Airi chuckle]: “Aw darn, it would have been cool if we were the same person”</li>
                    <li>Silence for a moment</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Were you close with your brother?”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Sort of, but not really. We are a different generation so to speak, he’s about 9 years
                        younger than me. He was also… very busy, much more than I ever was. My parents wanted a
                        successful son so they basically showered him with extra work. Since they stopped pushing things
                        on me after, I always felt a bit guilty while talking to my brother so I didn’t really talk to
                        him much”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Ah. I’m sorry to hear that”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It’s alright. Do you remember much about your sister?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: How did I feel about my sister…?”</li>
                    <li>We see a very short flashback of Mari crying. We cut back to Mari putting her hand on her head,
                        indicating she’s in pain</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Are you okay?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah sorry, I thought I remember something but… it doesn’t make sense”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “What did you remember?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “I see myself crying”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “While thinking about your sister?”</li>
                    <li>[Mari]: “Yeah, that’s why I don’t think it makes sense. Sorry other than that I couldn’t recall
                        much”</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “It’s okay. Let’s head back. I think we explored most if not everything now. Plus I’m
                        starving, let’s see what Comic has for us.</li>
                    <li>[Mari still had her hand on her head]: “Yeah, let’s head back”</li>
                    <li>Airi and Mari exit back to the waiting area</li>
                    <li>[Airi]: “Comic?”</li>
                    <li>Similar to previous scenes, a door will appear out of thin air and Comic pops his head out, but
                        this time he has a chef hat on his head. Comic gives them a grin and says “Come on in!” and Mari
                        and Airi enter as the scene fades to black.</li>
                </ul>
